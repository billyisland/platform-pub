# WORKSPACE EXPERIMENT ADR

*Date: 2026-05-01. Status: Active experiment, slices 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 2.5 + 2.6 + 2.7 + 2.8 shipped on branch. Branch: `workspace-experiment` (anchored at tag `pre-workspace-experiment`).*

## Context

The design corpus contains two incompatible navigation models. Phase A (`docs/adr/ALLHAUS-REDESIGN-SPEC.md`) is a topbar + global compose overlay sitting over a single feed, partially shipped on `master`. The workspace model (`WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md`, `WIREFRAME-DECISIONS-CONSOLIDATED.md`) replaces the topbar with a grey workspace floor on which users arrange ⊔-shaped vessels representing feeds, with an ∀ creation control in the bottom-right.

This branch explores whether the workspace model works without abandoning Phase A. Phase A remains canonical on `master`. If the experiment succeeds, the branch merges and Phase A is retired. If it doesn't, the branch is deleted; nothing is lost.

## Decisions

### 1. Workspace is canonical on this branch

The Phase A topbar and the global ComposeOverlay-as-currently-shipped are retired on this branch. The authenticated home becomes the workspace floor. The ∀ in the bottom-right is the only object-creation entry point at workspace scope.

### 2. Animation: Framer Motion

The ∀→H→⊔ transformation (Step 9) is choreographed, multi-element, with SVG morphing and snap transitions. CSS animations can express it but the choreography becomes painful. Lottie requires After Effects assets and a designer-developer handoff that doesn't exist here. Framer Motion is React-native, supports `AnimatePresence` for mount/unmount sequencing, has first-class SVG path animation, and brings gesture primitives (`useDrag`, gesture composition) we'll need for vessel manipulation. Use Framer Motion for both the ceremonial ∀→H→⊔ sequences and in-workspace gestures (drag, resize, rotate, brightness drag).

Provide a `prefers-reduced-motion` variant for the ∀→H→⊔ sequences — fade-in fallback rather than the full transformation.

### 3. Persistence: local-first

- **Workspace layout** (vessel position, size, brightness, density, orientation) → `localStorage` is the source of truth, keyed by user id. Background sync to a server table is deferred until the shape settles. A future server hydrate doesn't need shape changes if the localStorage shape is treated as canonical.
- **Feed definitions** (sources + weights + sampling mode) → server-backed from day one. New tables `feeds(id, owner_id, name, created_at, updated_at)` and `feed_sources(feed_id, source_id, weight, sampling_mode, muted_at)`. These describe what *content* a vessel pulls; the workspace layout merely positions vessels.
- **Saved items** → defer. Stub in code, no schema until the surface design solidifies.

### 4. State: Zustand, optimistic

Two new stores alongside `useCompose`:

- `useWorkspace` — vessels array, current drag/resize/rotate target, arrangement vs reading mode.
- `useFeed(feedId)` — content fetched from `/api/v1/feeds/:id/items`, scroll position, per-feed unread tracking.

`useCompose` extends in place per Steps 5/6: add `composerMode`, `forValue`, `nudgeDismissed`. Don't fork a new store.

All workspace mutations are optimistic — the local store updates immediately, the localStorage write is debounced (200ms), any future server sync is best-effort.

### 5. Mobile: deferred

The experiment is desktop-first. Pinch-to-resize, two-finger rotation, two-finger vertical brightness drag have no committed touch alternatives. The mobile geometry decision (Wireframe doc Open Item 10; Step 4 hardware-prototyping note) waits until desktop works. On mobile during the experiment, render a "desktop only" placeholder rather than a half-baked touch UI.

### 6. Accessibility: experiment floor

Not full WCAG AA. The floor for the experiment:

- All critical paths (compose, open article, vote, reply, subscribe, navigate between vessels) reachable by keyboard.
- Vessels render as `role="region"` with the feed name as `aria-label`.
- ∀ menu opens on Enter as well as click; arrow-key navigation through the four items.
- Long-press surface has a keyboard equivalent (e.g. `Shift+Enter` on a focused card).
- Screen-reader labels for all icon-only controls.
- Reduced-motion variant for the ∀ animations.

Deferred until the experiment graduates: contrast verification across all three brightness states (the brightness experiment intentionally degrades contrast), full keyboard model for drag/rotate/brightness, focus management for arrangement mode.

## What survives from current code

Untouched:
- All backend services (gateway, payment-service, key-service, key-custody, feed-ingest, relay).
- TipTap editor and extensions (`web/src/components/editor/`).
- NDK reading and event parsing (`web/src/lib/ndk.ts`).
- Universal resolver, atproto/mastodon adapters, relay outbox, all of `shared/`.
- `feed_items` table — vessel content comes from this same denormalised source.
- Trust pip data layer (`gateway/src/routes/trust.ts`, `trust_layer1`, `vouches`).
- Auth, payments, subscriptions, publications routes.

Adapted:
- Card data shapes survive; visual rendering reskinned per `CARDS-AND-PIP-PANEL-HANDOFF.md`.
- The existing publish pipelines (`publishNote` for kind 1, `messages.createConversation` + `messages.send` for encrypted DMs) are reused unchanged — the new composer is a fresh UI on top of the existing rails.

Resolved against pre-experiment forecasts:
- `useCompose` store does **not** extend — it retires alongside the `ComposeOverlay` shell. Workspace composer state is component-local until a second open-the-composer entry point exists, then a fresh `useWorkspaceCompose` (or similar) replaces it.
- The new `Composer` is **not** chrome wrapped around `ComposeOverlay`. It is a new component (`web/src/components/workspace/Composer.tsx`) — `ComposeOverlay` continues to render only on platform-mode routes (`/feed`, `/article/...`, etc.) and will be deleted before any merge to `master`.

Retired (on this branch only):
- Phase A topbar.
- `NoteComposer`, `ArticleComposePanel`, `ArticleEditor` — fold into `Composer`.
- `/feed` page (after the workspace is solid; coexists during build).
- The `/write` standalone editor page becomes a thin wrapper that renders `Composer` in article mode.

New:
- `Workspace` component (the floor), `Vessel` component (the ⊔), `Composer` (single-component note+article).
- `∀Menu`, `ContentLongPressPanel`, `FeedComposer` (vessel-as-editor mode).
- `useWorkspace`, `useFeed` Zustand stores.
- Framer Motion animation primitives for ∀→H→⊔ and vessel gestures.
- `feeds` + `feed_sources` migrations.
- `GET /api/v1/feeds`, `POST /api/v1/feeds`, `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/:id`, `DELETE /api/v1/feeds/:id`, `GET /api/v1/feeds/:id/items`.

## Migration within the branch

1. Build workspace at `/workspace` while `/feed` and `/write` still exist. Iterate without disrupting fallback paths.
2. Wire the authenticated home to `/workspace` when it feels right.
3. Delete retired code (NoteComposer, ArticleComposePanel, ArticleEditor, old `/feed`, topbar) before any eventual merge to `master`.

## Build log

### Slice 1 — vessel renders real content (2026-04-30, commits `5c76d33`, `9047a87`)

Smallest first slice. New `/workspace` route renders one centred ⊔ on a grey-100 floor, fetching from `/api/v1/feed?reach=explore` (the existing timeline endpoint — feeds API is slice 3) and rendering up to 12 wireframe-grammar cards inside.

- `web/src/app/workspace/page.tsx` — route entry.
- `web/src/components/workspace/Vessel.tsx` — chassis to Step 1 spec: 8px walls, 16px interior padding, 12px inter-card gap, 300px wide, medium-bright tokens (walls #4A4A47, interior #E6E5E0, cards #F5F4F0). Static — no drag/resize/rotate/brightness/density.
- `web/src/components/workspace/VesselCard.tsx` — card variants for article, note, external, and `new_user` (join announcement). Pip + author + standfirst, no avatars, no action strip. Tokens local to the file — not added to `tailwind.config.js`.
- `web/src/components/workspace/WorkspaceView.tsx` — floor + fetch + map.

Skipped intentionally: feeds tables, `useWorkspace` store, ∀ menu, animations, localStorage, drag/resize gestures.

### Slice 1.5 — chrome retired on /workspace (2026-04-30, commit `a67efc9`)

Per ADR §1, the Phase A topbar and `ComposeOverlay` are retired on this branch. Implementation:

- `useLayoutMode` gains a third mode, `workspace`, returned for `/workspace` and any sub-paths.
- `LayoutShell` now owns Nav / `ComposeOverlay` / `Footer` / main-padding rendering and suppresses all four in workspace mode. `app/layout.tsx` simplifies to `<LayoutShell>{children}</LayoutShell>`.
- `WorkspaceView` floor now fills `100vh` directly.

Other routes (`/feed`, `/write`, `/`, `/:username`, etc.) are untouched and keep platform chrome. Note: with no topbar there is currently no in-app navigation off `/workspace` — the ∀ menu (slice 2) becomes the navigation anchor.

### Slice 2 — ∀ menu (2026-05-01)

Persistent ∀ control fixed bottom-right of the workspace floor. Tap (or Enter when focused) reveals a four-item menu per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"Workspace scope": *New feed*, *New note*, *Fork feed by URL*, *Reset workspace layout*. Closes on outside click, Escape, or item select; focus returns to the ∀ button. Arrow-up/-down + Home/End cycle items; mouse hover and keyboard navigation share an `activeIndex`. The button is a 56px black disc with the ∀ glyph in Literata; menu is a small white sheet with a hairline black border, no scrim.

- `web/src/components/workspace/ForallMenu.tsx` — new component, fixed position, role=menu/menuitem.
- `WorkspaceView` mounts `<ForallMenu />` on the floor.
- All four item handlers are `console.log` stubs for this slice. Wiring lives in later slices: *new note* → `Composer` (per ADR §"Adapted"), *new feed* → `POST /api/v1/feeds` (slice 3), *fork by URL* → universal resolver, *reset layout* → `useWorkspace` (slice 4).
- No Framer Motion yet; ADR §2 reserves it for the ∀→H→⊔ ceremony and gestures. Menu reveal is a CSS transform/transition.

Skipped intentionally: ∀→H→⊔ animation, mobile placement (∀ position on touch is part of the deferred mobile decision per ADR §5), focus-trap inside the menu (single-level, Escape suffices for the experiment a11y floor).

### Slice 2.5 — minimal Composer wired to *New note* (2026-05-01)

`web/src/components/workspace/Composer.tsx` is the workspace's own composer surface — fresh component, *not* a reuse of the retired `ComposeOverlay`. Slice 2.5 ships note mode only.

- Centred panel over a 40% scrim, opens on ∀ → *New note*. Esc / scrim click / Cancel close it.
- Surface per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"The note composer": a To field above a body textarea. Empty To shows the persistent `Publishing publicly` banner; the action button reads `Publish`.
- To-field resolution and protocol selection are **not** wired this slice. Typing into To disables Publish and surfaces a hint that private addressing arrives in a later slice. This honours the spec's invariant — that the To field is *the* central narrowing gesture — without faking autocomplete.
- Body publishes via the existing `publishNote(content, user.pubkey)` pipeline (signed and outbox-enqueued through `/api/v1/notes`). Char limit 1000.
- On success the Composer closes and bumps a `feedRefreshTick` on `WorkspaceView`, which re-fetches the vessel's feed. No optimistic insertion yet — the new note appears via refetch, which is sufficient at slice 2.5 because the founder's-feed vessel is the only one and the user's own publish lands in `feed_items` immediately.
- State is local to `WorkspaceView`. The migration map flags the retired `stores/compose.ts` for rewrite (three-mode shell coordination retires with the overlay); this slice deliberately does not extend it. A workspace-scoped store arrives when a second open-the-composer entry point exists (e.g. reply from a card).

`ForallMenu` becomes controlled — it now takes `onAction(key)` rather than owning stub handlers. The other three actions (*new feed*, *fork by URL*, *reset layout*) remain stubs in `WorkspaceView.handleForallAction`.

Skipped intentionally: article mode, To-field autocomplete + resolver wiring, protocol selector, draft autosave, media attachments, the 400-word note→article nudge, optimistic feed insertion, mobile sheet geometry.

### Slice 2.6 — To-field resolver + protocol selector (2026-05-01)

The To field's central design role per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"The note composer" is the cardinality-determines-publication gesture. Slice 2.6 makes it real on the input side; publishing semantics catch up later.

**To field.** Composer-local input now wraps a chip row. Typing 300ms-debounce-resolves through the universal resolver (`POST /api/v1/resolve`, context `dm`) and Phase B polls (up to 3 ticks at 1s) — same shape as `SubscribeInput` but adapted for chip selection. Native account matches surface in a dropdown alongside fuzzy-matched broadcast tokens (*Everyone on all.haus / Nostr / Bluesky / fediverse*). Enter on the input adds the top person match; click adds either kind. Backspace on an empty input pops the last chip; per-chip × button removes any chip. Person chips render black, broadcast chips render light.

**Banner + button label.** Empty-or-broadcast-only To still shows the `Publishing publicly` banner; the button still reads `Publish`. Person chips suppress the banner.

**Protocol selector.** Visible only when the chip row is empty (per spec: "When the To field is empty, a subtle secondary control surfaces"). Four toggle pills — `ALL.HAUS · NOSTR · BLUESKY · ACTIVITYPUB` — all on by default. Stored in component state.

**Publish gating.**
- Person chips present → publish disabled with hint *Private addressing wires in a later slice — remove person chips to publish*. The DM/private-addressing pipeline is its own slice (the resolved chip carries the protocol, but encrypted DM dispatch + cross-protocol DM is non-trivial).
- Empty To with Nostr toggled off, or broadcast-only To without Nostr → publish disabled with hint *Cross-protocol broadcast wires later. Include Nostr to publish.* The hint is honest about what the existing `publishNote` pipeline does (it signs and outbox-enqueues a Nostr kind 1; cross-posting to ActivityPub / atproto requires `crossPost` + a `linked_account_id`, deferred).
- Otherwise (empty To with Nostr on, or broadcast-token-list-including-Nostr) → public publish via existing `publishNote(content, user.pubkey)`. Other-protocol toggles and other-protocol broadcast tokens are accepted by the UI and ignored at publish time; the gating hint and the *Send via* selector make this state visible.

**No store coupling.** All resolver state, chip state, and protocol state is local to `Composer.tsx`. The retired `stores/compose.ts` stays untouched.

Skipped intentionally: encrypted Nostr DM dispatch (person chips), cross-protocol broadcast publishing (lighting up Bluesky/ActivityPub toggles for real — needs `linked_accounts` integration), chip ordering / drag-reorder, "named groups" autocomplete, identity-resolution chains beyond `dm` context (e.g. RSS feeds aren't valid To targets), keyboard navigation inside the dropdown beyond Enter-on-top-match, To-field history / recents.

### Slice 2.7 — person chips dispatch as encrypted DMs (2026-05-01)

The cardinality-determines-publication invariant is now real for native targets. Publishing the composer with one or more person chips routes through the existing DM pipeline rather than the public publish path.

**Pipeline.** `Composer.handlePublish` branches on chip kind:
- *Person chips only* → `POST /conversations { memberIds }` then `POST /messages/:conversationId { content }`. The existing `gateway/src/services/messages.ts` handles NIP-44 encryption end-to-end via key-custody — the composer doesn't see plaintext leaving the browser any differently than the existing `/messages` page does. Multiple person chips form a group conversation in one call.
- *Empty / broadcast-only* → unchanged from slice 2.6 (public `publishNote` via Nostr).
- *Mixed* (person chips + broadcast tokens) → publish disabled with hint *Mixing people with broadcast targets isn't supported in one send*. Two intents in one gesture is genuinely ambiguous; one-or-the-other is the cleanest contract.

**Surface changes.**
- *Publishing publicly* banner is suppressed when any person chip is present (the publish is no longer public).
- Action button label flips: `Publish` → `Send` for private. `Publishing…` → `Sending…` while in flight.
- Hint reads *Sending privately to N recipient(s) — appears in their inbox at all.haus/messages.* — naming the destination so the user understands the gesture's outcome.
- DM-pricing skip handling: if `messages.send` returns a non-empty `skippedRecipientIds`, surface *Sent, but N recipient(s) were skipped — DM pricing not paid* and leave the composer open. Settling DM pricing happens via the existing `/settings/dm-pricing` flow; not in scope here.

**Conversation deduplication.** Each Send creates a fresh conversation, matching the existing `/messages` page's behaviour. Find-or-create on identical member sets is a separate UX call that depends on whether `/messages` survives as a list surface (migration map §5 #5 still open).

Skipped intentionally: find-or-create dedupe, send to a person chip with no UUID (resolver returned a confidence-`speculative` external account), per-conversation reply context, message threading from a vessel card, mirroring sent DMs into the workspace feed (they're private, they don't belong in `feed_items`).

### Slice 2.8 — cross-protocol broadcast for empty/broadcast-only To (2026-05-01)

The protocol toggles and "Everyone on Bluesky / fediverse" broadcast chips light up. A public publish now anchors on the native Nostr publish *and* fans out to the user's connected Bluesky / Mastodon accounts, on the back of the existing Phase 5 outbound pipeline.

**Wire-up.**
- The existing `outbound_posts.action_type` CHECK already includes `'original'` (`source_item_id` and `linked_account_id` are both nullable post-058) — no migration. The slot was reserved during Phase 5 and was never wired from the gateway side.
- `POST /notes` schema swaps the singular `crossPost` (`{linkedAccountId, sourceItemId, actionType: 'reply' | 'quote'}`) for plural `crossPosts: array`. Per-target Zod refinement enforces the invariant `actionType === 'original' ⇔ sourceItemId omitted`. The handler now loops + enqueues each entry; failures are logged and skipped per target so a Bluesky outage can't block a working Mastodon cross-post (or vice versa). The pre-2.8 single-target shape had no production callers — `publishNote` was the only frontend reference and the field was unused — so the rename is straight.
- `enqueueCrossPost` widens to `actionType: 'reply' | 'quote' | 'original'` and `sourceItemId?: string`. Migration 062's dedup index already keys on `(account_id, nostr_event_id, linked_account_id, action_type)` and tolerates NULL `source_item_id` via `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, so re-enqueues are still idempotent.
- `feed-ingest/src/tasks/outbound-cross-post.ts` accepts `'original'` for both atproto + activitypub. The Mastodon branch simply skips the quote-URL append + `replyToStatusUri`; the Bluesky branch skips the `reply` / `quote` strong-refs. The unsupported-action assertion in the atproto branch is now exhaustive (was implicit no-op fall-through).
- `web/src/lib/publishNote.ts`: `crossPost?: CrossPostTarget` → `crossPosts?: CrossPostTarget[]`. `CrossPostTarget.sourceItemId` is now optional and `actionType` includes `'original'`.

**Composer surface.**
- On open, `Composer` calls `linkedAccounts.list()` and bins valid accounts by protocol. The atproto + activitypub toggles in the *Send via* row reflect connection state: connected → toggleable as before; not connected → rendered disabled-grey with a `title` reading *Connect &lt;Bluesky/Activitypub&gt; in Settings → Linked accounts to broadcast there*. Native `ALL.HAUS` and `NOSTR` toggles are unaffected (always-on; `nostr` still gates the publish).
- Broadcast targets resolve from chips when broadcast chips are present, otherwise from the toggle set. Cross-post targets = `(broadcast_set ∩ {atproto, activitypub}) ∩ {protocols with valid linked account}`.
- Hint copy: when at least one cross-post target is queued, the char-count line becomes `Publishing to Nostr · BLUESKY · ACTIVITYPUB — N/1000`. The slice 2.6 *Cross-protocol broadcast wires later* hint is gone; the still-present *Include Nostr to publish* gate (Nostr-toggled-off broadcast) reads as *Cross-protocol broadcast needs Nostr as the anchor. Include Nostr to publish.* — matching the new reality that the *other* protocols *are* wired but Nostr remains the anchor.

**Worker payload shape.** Top-level cross-posts produce one `outbound_posts` row per target with `(linked_account_id = <atproto|activitypub linked>, source_item_id = NULL, action_type = 'original')`. Body text passes through the same grapheme/char budget truncation paths (`truncateWithLink`); on Bluesky truncation appends the all.haus permalink, on Mastodon nothing (no quote URL since there's no source). Idempotency keys (`outbound_posts.id`) are stable across retries.

Skipped intentionally: cross-protocol broadcast that *omits* Nostr (still requires the anchor — sliced separately because the all.haus DB record currently keys on a Nostr event id), per-protocol body customisation (mentions, language tags, sensitive-content flags), per-target preview before send, post-publish toast surfacing the cross-post status, retry/abandon UI on the workspace floor (status lives in `outbound_posts`; surfacing it is its own slice), broadcast-to-self filtering (a user sending "Everyone on Bluesky" doesn't get a status from their own bridge — same as today since the cross-post writes to the linked account, not the source feed).
