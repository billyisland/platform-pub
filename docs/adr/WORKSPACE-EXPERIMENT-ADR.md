# WORKSPACE EXPERIMENT ADR

*Date: 2026-05-01. Status: Active experiment, slices 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 2.5 + 2.6 + 2.7 + 2.8 + 3 + 4 + 5a + 5b + 5c + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 shipped on branch. Branch: `workspace-experiment` (anchored at tag `pre-workspace-experiment`).*

## Context

The design corpus contains two incompatible navigation models. Phase A (`docs/adr/ALLHAUS-REDESIGN-SPEC.md`) is a topbar + global compose overlay sitting over a single feed, partially shipped on `master`. The workspace model (`WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md`, `WIREFRAME-DECISIONS-CONSOLIDATED.md`) replaces the topbar with a grey workspace floor on which users arrange ⊔-shaped vessels representing feeds, with an ∀ creation control in the bottom-right.

This branch explores whether the workspace model works without abandoning Phase A. Phase A remains canonical on `master`. If the experiment succeeds, the branch merges and Phase A is retired. If it doesn't, the branch is deleted; nothing is lost.

## Decisions

### 1. Workspace is canonical on this branch

The Phase A topbar and the global ComposeOverlay-as-currently-shipped are retired on this branch. The authenticated home becomes the workspace floor. The ∀ in the bottom-right is the only object-creation entry point at workspace scope.

### 2. Animation: Framer Motion

The ∀→H→⊔ transformation (Step 9) is choreographed, multi-element, with SVG morphing and snap transitions. CSS animations can express it but the choreography becomes painful. Lottie requires After Effects assets and a designer-developer handoff that doesn't exist here. Framer Motion is React-native, supports `AnimatePresence` for mount/unmount sequencing, has first-class SVG path animation, and brings gesture primitives (`useDrag`, gesture composition) we'll need for vessel manipulation. Use Framer Motion for both the ceremonial ∀→H→⊔ sequences and in-workspace gestures (drag, resize, rotate, brightness drag).

Provide a `prefers-reduced-motion` variant for the ∀→H→⊔ sequences — fade-in fallback rather than the full transformation.

### 3. Persistence: local-first

- **Workspace layout** (vessel position, size, brightness, density, orientation) → `localStorage` is the source of truth, keyed by user id. Background sync to a server table is deferred until the shape settles. A future server hydrate doesn't need shape changes if the localStorage shape is treated as canonical.
- **Feed definitions** (sources + weights + sampling mode) → server-backed from day one. New tables `feeds(id, owner_id, name, created_at, updated_at)` and `feed_sources(feed_id, source_id, weight, sampling_mode, muted_at)`. These describe what *content* a vessel pulls; the workspace layout merely positions vessels.
- **Saved items** → defer. Stub in code, no schema until the surface design solidifies.

### 4. State: Zustand, optimistic

Two new stores alongside `useCompose`:

- `useWorkspace` — vessels array, current drag/resize/rotate target, arrangement vs reading mode.
- `useFeed(feedId)` — content fetched from `/api/v1/feeds/:id/items`, scroll position, per-feed unread tracking.

`useCompose` extends in place per Steps 5/6: add `composerMode`, `forValue`, `nudgeDismissed`. Don't fork a new store.

All workspace mutations are optimistic — the local store updates immediately, the localStorage write is debounced (200ms), any future server sync is best-effort.

### 5. Mobile: deferred

The experiment is desktop-first. Pinch-to-resize, two-finger rotation, two-finger vertical brightness drag have no committed touch alternatives. The mobile geometry decision (Wireframe doc Open Item 10; Step 4 hardware-prototyping note) waits until desktop works. On mobile during the experiment, render a "desktop only" placeholder rather than a half-baked touch UI.

### 6. Accessibility: experiment floor

Not full WCAG AA. The floor for the experiment:

- All critical paths (compose, open article, vote, reply, subscribe, navigate between vessels) reachable by keyboard.
- Vessels render as `role="region"` with the feed name as `aria-label`.
- ∀ menu opens on Enter as well as click; arrow-key navigation through the four items.
- Long-press surface has a keyboard equivalent (e.g. `Shift+Enter` on a focused card).
- Screen-reader labels for all icon-only controls.
- Reduced-motion variant for the ∀ animations.

Deferred until the experiment graduates: contrast verification across all three brightness states (the brightness experiment intentionally degrades contrast), full keyboard model for drag/rotate/brightness, focus management for arrangement mode.

## What survives from current code

Untouched:
- All backend services (gateway, payment-service, key-service, key-custody, feed-ingest, relay).
- TipTap editor and extensions (`web/src/components/editor/`).
- NDK reading and event parsing (`web/src/lib/ndk.ts`).
- Universal resolver, atproto/mastodon adapters, relay outbox, all of `shared/`.
- `feed_items` table — vessel content comes from this same denormalised source.
- Trust pip data layer (`gateway/src/routes/trust.ts`, `trust_layer1`, `vouches`).
- Auth, payments, subscriptions, publications routes.

Adapted:
- Card data shapes survive; visual rendering reskinned per `CARDS-AND-PIP-PANEL-HANDOFF.md`.
- The existing publish pipelines (`publishNote` for kind 1, `messages.createConversation` + `messages.send` for encrypted DMs) are reused unchanged — the new composer is a fresh UI on top of the existing rails.

Resolved against pre-experiment forecasts:
- `useCompose` store does **not** extend — it retires alongside the `ComposeOverlay` shell. Workspace composer state is component-local until a second open-the-composer entry point exists, then a fresh `useWorkspaceCompose` (or similar) replaces it.
- The new `Composer` is **not** chrome wrapped around `ComposeOverlay`. It is a new component (`web/src/components/workspace/Composer.tsx`) — `ComposeOverlay` continues to render only on platform-mode routes (`/feed`, `/article/...`, etc.) and will be deleted before any merge to `master`.

Retired (on this branch only):
- Phase A topbar.
- `NoteComposer`, `ArticleComposePanel`, `ArticleEditor` — fold into `Composer`.
- `/feed` page (after the workspace is solid; coexists during build).
- The `/write` standalone editor page becomes a thin wrapper that renders `Composer` in article mode.

New:
- `Workspace` component (the floor), `Vessel` component (the ⊔), `Composer` (single-component note+article).
- `∀Menu`, `ContentLongPressPanel`, `FeedComposer` (vessel-as-editor mode).
- `useWorkspace`, `useFeed` Zustand stores.
- Framer Motion animation primitives for ∀→H→⊔ and vessel gestures.
- `feeds` + `feed_sources` migrations.
- `GET /api/v1/feeds`, `POST /api/v1/feeds`, `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/:id`, `DELETE /api/v1/feeds/:id`, `GET /api/v1/feeds/:id/items`.

## Migration within the branch

1. Build workspace at `/workspace` while `/feed` and `/write` still exist. Iterate without disrupting fallback paths.
2. Wire the authenticated home to `/workspace` when it feels right.
3. Delete retired code (NoteComposer, ArticleComposePanel, ArticleEditor, old `/feed`, topbar) before any eventual merge to `master`.

## Build log

### Slice 1 — vessel renders real content (2026-04-30, commits `5c76d33`, `9047a87`)

Smallest first slice. New `/workspace` route renders one centred ⊔ on a grey-100 floor, fetching from `/api/v1/feed?reach=explore` (the existing timeline endpoint — feeds API is slice 3) and rendering up to 12 wireframe-grammar cards inside.

- `web/src/app/workspace/page.tsx` — route entry.
- `web/src/components/workspace/Vessel.tsx` — chassis to Step 1 spec: 8px walls, 16px interior padding, 12px inter-card gap, 300px wide, medium-bright tokens (walls #4A4A47, interior #E6E5E0, cards #F5F4F0). Static — no drag/resize/rotate/brightness/density.
- `web/src/components/workspace/VesselCard.tsx` — card variants for article, note, external, and `new_user` (join announcement). Pip + author + standfirst, no avatars, no action strip. Tokens local to the file — not added to `tailwind.config.js`.
- `web/src/components/workspace/WorkspaceView.tsx` — floor + fetch + map.

Skipped intentionally: feeds tables, `useWorkspace` store, ∀ menu, animations, localStorage, drag/resize gestures.

### Slice 1.5 — chrome retired on /workspace (2026-04-30, commit `a67efc9`)

Per ADR §1, the Phase A topbar and `ComposeOverlay` are retired on this branch. Implementation:

- `useLayoutMode` gains a third mode, `workspace`, returned for `/workspace` and any sub-paths.
- `LayoutShell` now owns Nav / `ComposeOverlay` / `Footer` / main-padding rendering and suppresses all four in workspace mode. `app/layout.tsx` simplifies to `<LayoutShell>{children}</LayoutShell>`.
- `WorkspaceView` floor now fills `100vh` directly.

Other routes (`/feed`, `/write`, `/`, `/:username`, etc.) are untouched and keep platform chrome. Note: with no topbar there is currently no in-app navigation off `/workspace` — the ∀ menu (slice 2) becomes the navigation anchor.

### Slice 2 — ∀ menu (2026-05-01)

Persistent ∀ control fixed bottom-right of the workspace floor. Tap (or Enter when focused) reveals a four-item menu per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"Workspace scope": *New feed*, *New note*, *Fork feed by URL*, *Reset workspace layout*. Closes on outside click, Escape, or item select; focus returns to the ∀ button. Arrow-up/-down + Home/End cycle items; mouse hover and keyboard navigation share an `activeIndex`. The button is a 56px black disc with the ∀ glyph in Literata; menu is a small white sheet with a hairline black border, no scrim.

- `web/src/components/workspace/ForallMenu.tsx` — new component, fixed position, role=menu/menuitem.
- `WorkspaceView` mounts `<ForallMenu />` on the floor.
- All four item handlers are `console.log` stubs for this slice. Wiring lives in later slices: *new note* → `Composer` (per ADR §"Adapted"), *new feed* → `POST /api/v1/feeds` (slice 3), *fork by URL* → universal resolver, *reset layout* → `useWorkspace` (slice 4).
- No Framer Motion yet; ADR §2 reserves it for the ∀→H→⊔ ceremony and gestures. Menu reveal is a CSS transform/transition.

Skipped intentionally: ∀→H→⊔ animation, mobile placement (∀ position on touch is part of the deferred mobile decision per ADR §5), focus-trap inside the menu (single-level, Escape suffices for the experiment a11y floor).

### Slice 2.5 — minimal Composer wired to *New note* (2026-05-01)

`web/src/components/workspace/Composer.tsx` is the workspace's own composer surface — fresh component, *not* a reuse of the retired `ComposeOverlay`. Slice 2.5 ships note mode only.

- Centred panel over a 40% scrim, opens on ∀ → *New note*. Esc / scrim click / Cancel close it.
- Surface per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"The note composer": a To field above a body textarea. Empty To shows the persistent `Publishing publicly` banner; the action button reads `Publish`.
- To-field resolution and protocol selection are **not** wired this slice. Typing into To disables Publish and surfaces a hint that private addressing arrives in a later slice. This honours the spec's invariant — that the To field is *the* central narrowing gesture — without faking autocomplete.
- Body publishes via the existing `publishNote(content, user.pubkey)` pipeline (signed and outbox-enqueued through `/api/v1/notes`). Char limit 1000.
- On success the Composer closes and bumps a `feedRefreshTick` on `WorkspaceView`, which re-fetches the vessel's feed. No optimistic insertion yet — the new note appears via refetch, which is sufficient at slice 2.5 because the founder's-feed vessel is the only one and the user's own publish lands in `feed_items` immediately.
- State is local to `WorkspaceView`. The migration map flags the retired `stores/compose.ts` for rewrite (three-mode shell coordination retires with the overlay); this slice deliberately does not extend it. A workspace-scoped store arrives when a second open-the-composer entry point exists (e.g. reply from a card).

`ForallMenu` becomes controlled — it now takes `onAction(key)` rather than owning stub handlers. The other three actions (*new feed*, *fork by URL*, *reset layout*) remain stubs in `WorkspaceView.handleForallAction`.

Skipped intentionally: article mode, To-field autocomplete + resolver wiring, protocol selector, draft autosave, media attachments, the 400-word note→article nudge, optimistic feed insertion, mobile sheet geometry.

### Slice 2.6 — To-field resolver + protocol selector (2026-05-01)

The To field's central design role per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"The note composer" is the cardinality-determines-publication gesture. Slice 2.6 makes it real on the input side; publishing semantics catch up later.

**To field.** Composer-local input now wraps a chip row. Typing 300ms-debounce-resolves through the universal resolver (`POST /api/v1/resolve`, context `dm`) and Phase B polls (up to 3 ticks at 1s) — same shape as `SubscribeInput` but adapted for chip selection. Native account matches surface in a dropdown alongside fuzzy-matched broadcast tokens (*Everyone on all.haus / Nostr / Bluesky / fediverse*). Enter on the input adds the top person match; click adds either kind. Backspace on an empty input pops the last chip; per-chip × button removes any chip. Person chips render black, broadcast chips render light.

**Banner + button label.** Empty-or-broadcast-only To still shows the `Publishing publicly` banner; the button still reads `Publish`. Person chips suppress the banner.

**Protocol selector.** Visible only when the chip row is empty (per spec: "When the To field is empty, a subtle secondary control surfaces"). Four toggle pills — `ALL.HAUS · NOSTR · BLUESKY · ACTIVITYPUB` — all on by default. Stored in component state.

**Publish gating.**
- Person chips present → publish disabled with hint *Private addressing wires in a later slice — remove person chips to publish*. The DM/private-addressing pipeline is its own slice (the resolved chip carries the protocol, but encrypted DM dispatch + cross-protocol DM is non-trivial).
- Empty To with Nostr toggled off, or broadcast-only To without Nostr → publish disabled with hint *Cross-protocol broadcast wires later. Include Nostr to publish.* The hint is honest about what the existing `publishNote` pipeline does (it signs and outbox-enqueues a Nostr kind 1; cross-posting to ActivityPub / atproto requires `crossPost` + a `linked_account_id`, deferred).
- Otherwise (empty To with Nostr on, or broadcast-token-list-including-Nostr) → public publish via existing `publishNote(content, user.pubkey)`. Other-protocol toggles and other-protocol broadcast tokens are accepted by the UI and ignored at publish time; the gating hint and the *Send via* selector make this state visible.

**No store coupling.** All resolver state, chip state, and protocol state is local to `Composer.tsx`. The retired `stores/compose.ts` stays untouched.

Skipped intentionally: encrypted Nostr DM dispatch (person chips), cross-protocol broadcast publishing (lighting up Bluesky/ActivityPub toggles for real — needs `linked_accounts` integration), chip ordering / drag-reorder, "named groups" autocomplete, identity-resolution chains beyond `dm` context (e.g. RSS feeds aren't valid To targets), keyboard navigation inside the dropdown beyond Enter-on-top-match, To-field history / recents.

### Slice 2.7 — person chips dispatch as encrypted DMs (2026-05-01)

The cardinality-determines-publication invariant is now real for native targets. Publishing the composer with one or more person chips routes through the existing DM pipeline rather than the public publish path.

**Pipeline.** `Composer.handlePublish` branches on chip kind:
- *Person chips only* → `POST /conversations { memberIds }` then `POST /messages/:conversationId { content }`. The existing `gateway/src/services/messages.ts` handles NIP-44 encryption end-to-end via key-custody — the composer doesn't see plaintext leaving the browser any differently than the existing `/messages` page does. Multiple person chips form a group conversation in one call.
- *Empty / broadcast-only* → unchanged from slice 2.6 (public `publishNote` via Nostr).
- *Mixed* (person chips + broadcast tokens) → publish disabled with hint *Mixing people with broadcast targets isn't supported in one send*. Two intents in one gesture is genuinely ambiguous; one-or-the-other is the cleanest contract.

**Surface changes.**
- *Publishing publicly* banner is suppressed when any person chip is present (the publish is no longer public).
- Action button label flips: `Publish` → `Send` for private. `Publishing…` → `Sending…` while in flight.
- Hint reads *Sending privately to N recipient(s) — appears in their inbox at all.haus/messages.* — naming the destination so the user understands the gesture's outcome.
- DM-pricing skip handling: if `messages.send` returns a non-empty `skippedRecipientIds`, surface *Sent, but N recipient(s) were skipped — DM pricing not paid* and leave the composer open. Settling DM pricing happens via the existing `/settings/dm-pricing` flow; not in scope here.

**Conversation deduplication.** Each Send creates a fresh conversation, matching the existing `/messages` page's behaviour. Find-or-create on identical member sets is a separate UX call that depends on whether `/messages` survives as a list surface (migration map §5 #5 still open).

Skipped intentionally: find-or-create dedupe, send to a person chip with no UUID (resolver returned a confidence-`speculative` external account), per-conversation reply context, message threading from a vessel card, mirroring sent DMs into the workspace feed (they're private, they don't belong in `feed_items`).

### Slice 2.8 — cross-protocol broadcast for empty/broadcast-only To (2026-05-01)

The protocol toggles and "Everyone on Bluesky / fediverse" broadcast chips light up. A public publish now anchors on the native Nostr publish *and* fans out to the user's connected Bluesky / Mastodon accounts, on the back of the existing Phase 5 outbound pipeline.

**Wire-up.**
- The existing `outbound_posts.action_type` CHECK already includes `'original'` (`source_item_id` and `linked_account_id` are both nullable post-058) — no migration. The slot was reserved during Phase 5 and was never wired from the gateway side.
- `POST /notes` schema swaps the singular `crossPost` (`{linkedAccountId, sourceItemId, actionType: 'reply' | 'quote'}`) for plural `crossPosts: array`. Per-target Zod refinement enforces the invariant `actionType === 'original' ⇔ sourceItemId omitted`. The handler now loops + enqueues each entry; failures are logged and skipped per target so a Bluesky outage can't block a working Mastodon cross-post (or vice versa). The pre-2.8 single-target shape had no production callers — `publishNote` was the only frontend reference and the field was unused — so the rename is straight.
- `enqueueCrossPost` widens to `actionType: 'reply' | 'quote' | 'original'` and `sourceItemId?: string`. Migration 062's dedup index already keys on `(account_id, nostr_event_id, linked_account_id, action_type)` and tolerates NULL `source_item_id` via `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, so re-enqueues are still idempotent.
- `feed-ingest/src/tasks/outbound-cross-post.ts` accepts `'original'` for both atproto + activitypub. The Mastodon branch simply skips the quote-URL append + `replyToStatusUri`; the Bluesky branch skips the `reply` / `quote` strong-refs. The unsupported-action assertion in the atproto branch is now exhaustive (was implicit no-op fall-through).
- `web/src/lib/publishNote.ts`: `crossPost?: CrossPostTarget` → `crossPosts?: CrossPostTarget[]`. `CrossPostTarget.sourceItemId` is now optional and `actionType` includes `'original'`.

**Composer surface.**
- On open, `Composer` calls `linkedAccounts.list()` and bins valid accounts by protocol. The atproto + activitypub toggles in the *Send via* row reflect connection state: connected → toggleable as before; not connected → rendered disabled-grey with a `title` reading *Connect &lt;Bluesky/Activitypub&gt; in Settings → Linked accounts to broadcast there*. Native `ALL.HAUS` and `NOSTR` toggles are unaffected (always-on; `nostr` still gates the publish).
- Broadcast targets resolve from chips when broadcast chips are present, otherwise from the toggle set. Cross-post targets = `(broadcast_set ∩ {atproto, activitypub}) ∩ {protocols with valid linked account}`.
- Hint copy: when at least one cross-post target is queued, the char-count line becomes `Publishing to Nostr · BLUESKY · ACTIVITYPUB — N/1000`. The slice 2.6 *Cross-protocol broadcast wires later* hint is gone; the still-present *Include Nostr to publish* gate (Nostr-toggled-off broadcast) reads as *Cross-protocol broadcast needs Nostr as the anchor. Include Nostr to publish.* — matching the new reality that the *other* protocols *are* wired but Nostr remains the anchor.

**Worker payload shape.** Top-level cross-posts produce one `outbound_posts` row per target with `(linked_account_id = <atproto|activitypub linked>, source_item_id = NULL, action_type = 'original')`. Body text passes through the same grapheme/char budget truncation paths (`truncateWithLink`); on Bluesky truncation appends the all.haus permalink, on Mastodon nothing (no quote URL since there's no source). Idempotency keys (`outbound_posts.id`) are stable across retries.

Skipped intentionally: cross-protocol broadcast that *omits* Nostr (still requires the anchor — sliced separately because the all.haus DB record currently keys on a Nostr event id), per-protocol body customisation (mentions, language tags, sensitive-content flags), per-target preview before send, post-publish toast surfacing the cross-post status, retry/abandon UI on the workspace floor (status lives in `outbound_posts`; surfacing it is its own slice), broadcast-to-self filtering (a user sending "Everyone on Bluesky" doesn't get a status from their own bridge — same as today since the cross-post writes to the linked account, not the source feed).

### Slice 3 — feeds schema + CRUD + multi-vessel workspace (2026-05-01)

The `feeds` object becomes real. A vessel is now a render of a server-backed feed, not a hardcoded explore query, and ∀ → *New feed* spawns a fresh vessel.

**Schema (migration 077).** `feeds(id, owner_id, name, created_at, updated_at)` with an 80-char name guard and an `owner_id, created_at` index. `feed_sources(feed_id, source_type, account_id|publication_id|external_source_id|tag_name, weight, sampling_mode, muted_at)` with a target-matches-type CHECK and per-type partial unique indexes so the same target can't double-up. `weight` and `sampling_mode` are reserved columns for the eventual ranking story (ADR §3) — slice 3's items query ignores both. `feed_sources` mutations bump `feeds.updated_at` via trigger so workspace ordering stays correct without route-side coordination.

**Routes (`gateway/src/routes/feeds.ts`).** `GET /api/v1/feeds` (list mine), `POST /api/v1/feeds {name}`, `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/:id {name}`, `DELETE /api/v1/feeds/:id`, `GET /api/v1/feeds/:id/items`. Owner-private: every read and write asserts `owner_id = session.sub`. Zod-validated bodies, UUID guard on params. Items returns `{feed, items, nextCursor, placeholder}`. When `feed_sources` is empty, `placeholder: true` and items mirror the explore query (cursoring on `(score, published_at, id)`); when sources exist, slice 3 returns an empty array with a TODO until source-set wiring lands. The placeholder query is a deliberate small duplication of `timeline.ts`'s explore branch — `timeline.ts` keeps its helpers module-private and the duplication retires when source semantics arrive.

**Web client (`web/src/lib/api/feeds.ts`).** New `workspaceFeeds` namespace exporting `list / create / rename / remove / items` plus `WorkspaceFeed` and `WorkspaceFeedItemsResponse` types. Renamed away from `feeds` because the existing `external-feeds.ts` already exports a `feeds` namespace for RSS/Mastodon/Bluesky/Nostr subscriptions on `/subscriptions`; collision would have shadowed both.

**Workspace (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** Bootstraps on first authenticated load: list feeds; if none exist create the default "Founder's feed"; render one `Vessel` per feed with parallel `items()` fetches. Vessels lay out via `flex flex-wrap gap-8` on the floor — multi-vessel arrives with the multi-feed object, not as a separate slice. Composer's `onPublished` now refreshes every vessel.

**∀ menu *New feed* wired.** New `NewFeedPrompt` modal (matches `Composer`'s scrim/panel grammar) takes a name (1–80 chars), POSTs, and appends a vessel that immediately fetches its placeholder items. Body copy is honest about the placeholder: *Sources arrive in a later slice — for now this feed shows the explore stream.* Cancel / Esc / scrim-click closes; Enter submits.

Skipped intentionally: rename UI on existing vessels, delete UI on vessels, source-set authoring (the actual point of having a feed object — wiring `feed_sources` rows from follows / publications / external subscriptions / tags is the next slice's territory), per-vessel pagination beyond the first 20 items, optimistic cross-vessel publish (the user's own publish lands in `feed_items` and only its source feeds should refetch — currently every vessel does), drag-to-reposition (still no `useWorkspace` store), multi-feed empty state UX (each vessel shows its own NO ITEMS independently). The *Fork feed by URL* and *Reset workspace layout* ∀ items remain `console.log` stubs.

### Slice 4 — feed composer: source CRUD + items query honours sources (2026-05-01)

The `feeds` object becomes load-bearing. A vessel's name label is now a click-to-open affordance for the feed composer; the composer authors `feed_sources` rows; the items query fans out across them rather than falling back to explore.

**Routes (`gateway/src/routes/feeds.ts`).** Three new endpoints alongside the slice 3 surface:
- `GET /api/v1/feeds/:id/sources` — list rows with target display info (account / publication / external_source / tag) via LEFT JOINs against each potential target table. The `display` block is computed server-side so the client doesn't re-derive labels.
- `POST /api/v1/feeds/:id/sources` — discriminated-union body. Native targets (`account`, `publication`, `tag`) pass an existing UUID or, for tag, a name (auto-inserted into `tags` so `/tag/:name` and global tag listings stay consistent). External takes either an existing `externalSourceId` or a `(protocol, sourceUri[, displayName, …])` pair. The pair shape upserts `external_sources` and ensures an `external_subscriptions` row for the caller (in one txn) so the existing feed-ingest workers pick the source up; an immediate fetch job is enqueued for `rss` / `nostr_external` / `activitypub` (atproto rides Jetstream's 60s DID refresh). The per-type partial unique indexes from migration 077 surface as `409 Source already on feed`.
- `DELETE /api/v1/feeds/:id/sources/:sourceId` — straight delete. The associated `external_subscriptions` row is deliberately *not* torn down: a user may keep the subscription via `/subscriptions` or use the same external source in another feed. Subscription teardown is its own gesture.

**Items query (`sourceFilteredItems`).** Replaces slice 3's empty-set placeholder for non-empty source sets. Single SELECT against `feed_items`, with the source set expressed as four OR-ed `EXISTS` clauses: account → `fi.author_id = fs.account_id`, publication → `a.publication_id = fs.publication_id`, external_source → `fi.source_id = fs.external_source_id`, tag → `EXISTS` join through `article_tags + tags`. Reused `FEED_SELECT` / `FEED_JOINS` / `rowToItem` from the placeholder branch. `muted_at IS NULL` filters per source. Empty-source feeds still hit the explore placeholder. Cursor narrows from `(score, published_at, id)` to `(published_at, id)` because slice 4 doesn't yet rank across sources — chronological is the honest contract until `weight` + `sampling_mode` wire in.

**Web client (`web/src/lib/api/feeds.ts`).** Three new methods on `workspaceFeeds`: `listSources / addSource / removeSource`. New types `WorkspaceFeedSource`, `WorkspaceFeedSourceKind`, `AddWorkspaceFeedSourceInput` (the discriminated union mirroring the route shape).

**Composer (`web/src/components/workspace/FeedComposer.tsx`).** New component, scrim/panel grammar matching `Composer` and `NewFeedPrompt`. Reached by clicking the vessel name label (`Vessel.tsx` gained an `onNameClick` prop — long-press lives in the gesture system not yet built). Shows the feed name as header, lists current sources with × remove buttons, and offers an "Add a source" input that resolver-debounces (300ms + Phase B polling, context `subscribe`) and renders match candidates (native account / external source / RSS feed). Click a candidate → POST → list refreshes → `onSourcesChanged` triggers `loadVesselItems` on the affected vessel. Tag fallback: input starting with `#` offers a literal `tag` add when the resolver returns nothing useful (the resolver doesn't classify `#tag` natively). Honest empty state: *No sources yet — this feed shows the explore stream until you add one.*

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** New `feedComposerFor: WorkspaceFeed | null` state; vessel name onClick sets it. After source change the affected vessel re-fetches via the existing `loadVesselItems`.

Skipped intentionally: rename / delete UI on vessels (routes already exist; needs its own confirm-flow), per-source weight / sampling-mode authoring (columns reserved, no UX yet), source mute toggle (column reserved, no UI), drag to reorder sources, paste-URL one-shot (the *Fork feed by URL* ∀ item — naturally a *create feed* + *add source* combo, deferred), the `external_subscriptions` cap check on POST `/feeds/:id/sources` (the existing `/feeds/subscribe` route enforces a 200-cap; slice 4 trusts the caller — a real cap on workspace adds is a follow-up that probably belongs in a shared helper), bulk import (selecting current follows en masse to seed a feed), and per-vessel pagination beyond 20 items. The *Reset workspace layout* ∀ item remains a `console.log` stub.

### Slice 5a — vessel drag-to-position + localStorage layout (2026-05-01)

The first vessel gesture. Vessels stop flex-wrapping and become absolutely-positioned objects on the floor, draggable by the name label, with positions persisted to localStorage per user. Framer Motion enters the codebase for the first time.

**New surfaces.**
- `web/src/stores/workspace.ts` — `useWorkspace` Zustand store. `positions: Record<feedId, {x,y}>`, `hydrate(userId)`, `setVesselPosition(feedId, pos)`, `removeVessel(feedId)`, `reset()`. localStorage key `workspace:layout:<userId>`, debounced 200ms write. Quota-exceeded / private-browsing failures swallowed silently — the in-memory layout is authoritative for the session, the persistence is best-effort. Per ADR §3 there is no server sync this slice.
- `web/src/lib/workspace/motion.ts` — small Framer Motion config (drag spring, reduced-motion variant, `prefersReducedMotion()` helper). Slice 5a actually uses none of the spring config because `dragMomentum={false}` settles the vessel exactly where the cursor was; the file exists for the resize / rotate / ∀→H→⊔ slices that *do* need it.

**Vessel changes (`Vessel.tsx`).** The chassis is now a `motion.div` with `position: absolute`, `x` / `y` motion values mirrored to `position` props via a `useEffect`. `drag` is enabled but `dragListener` is `false` — drag only initiates when `dragControls.start(event)` fires from the name label's `onPointerDown`. Cards inside the vessel stay clickable. `dragMomentum={false}` + `dragElastic={0}` — no springy slide-back, no overshoot. `dragConstraints` accepts a `RefObject<HTMLElement>` from the parent so vessels can't be dragged off the floor and lost. A `dragMovedRef` flag tracks whether the gesture was a drag or a click; the name-label `onClick` (which opens `FeedComposer`) is suppressed if any movement occurred during the gesture, so dragging the label doesn't accidentally open the composer.

**WorkspaceView changes.** Floor becomes `position: relative`, `height: 100vh`, `overflow: hidden`. A `floorRef` is threaded into each `Vessel` as `dragConstraints`. The bootstrap effect now blocks on `useWorkspace.hydrated` so default-slot writes never overwrite a stored layout. After hydration, for each feed without a stored position, a default grid slot is computed (340px col width = 300px vessel + 40px gutter, 32px outer padding, wraps at viewport width) and written back. `handleCreateFeed` does the same for newly-created vessels: next-slot default at the time of creation. The `flex flex-wrap justify-center` wrapper is gone; vessels live as absolutely-positioned children of the floor. Loading / error hints centre on the floor via `position: absolute; top/left: 50%; translate(-50%, -50%)`.

**Behaviour.** Position is `{x, y}` in floor coordinates (top-left origin). `dragConstraints` clamps to the floor element's box, so a vessel can't be lost off-screen. No no-overlap rule — overlap is allowed in slice 5a; Wireframe §3's no-overlap commitment waits until resize/brightness slices land and the spatial economics matter.

**No new dependencies on Framer Motion ceremonies.** `motion.div` only — no `AnimatePresence`, no path animation, no SVG morphing. The ∀→H→⊔ ceremonial sequence (Slice 9 / Step 9) and the brightness / density gestures will pull in more of the API; this slice deliberately stays minimal.

**Reset workspace layout (∀ menu item) still stubbed.** The store's `reset()` exists and is exported; wiring the ∀ item is a small follow-up that probably wants a confirm modal first.

Skipped intentionally: vessel resize (next slice), brightness / density / rotation (Step 2 wireframe), no-overlap collision detection, scrollable canvas beyond viewport, server-side persistence (still localStorage-only per ADR §3), keyboard equivalents for drag (deferred per ADR §6 a11y floor — vessels remain keyboard-reachable as `role="region"`, just not keyboard-positionable), mobile touch geometry (still desktop-only per ADR §5), default-grid recompute on viewport resize (the slot formula reads `window.innerWidth` once at bootstrap; if the user resizes their browser drastically the existing layout stays put rather than reflowing), garbage-collect orphaned `positions` entries when feeds are deleted on another device (`removeVessel` exists but isn't wired to deletion yet because vessel deletion UI doesn't exist).

### Slice 5b — vessel resize via bottom-right corner (2026-05-01)

The second vessel gesture. Vessels gain a quiet resize handle at the bottom-right corner of the chassis; drag widens / lengthens the vessel; size persists alongside position in localStorage.

**Store changes (`useWorkspace`).** `VesselLayout` extends from `{x, y}` to `{x, y, w?, h?}`. New `setVesselSize(feedId, {w, h})` merges into the existing record under the same `workspace:layout:<userId>` key, debounced 200ms. Slice-5a values (positions only) read forward without migration — `w` / `h` are optional and undefined means "use the vessel's intrinsic size."

**Vessel changes (`Vessel.tsx`).** New `size?: {w?, h?}` and `onSizeCommit?` props. The chassis becomes `position: relative` so the handle can pin to its bottom-right; a 16×16 hit area at `right: -8, bottom: -8` (offsetting the 8px wall) carries a small ◢ glyph at low opacity. Resize is plain `onPointerDown` + `setPointerCapture` + `onPointerMove` — Framer Motion's `drag` API is for translation, not bounded resize, so the handle owns its own gesture path. `liveSize` state mirrors the in-flight value during the drag and is committed on `onPointerUp`. Min 220×200 per spec ("below which content becomes illegible"); max 2000×2000 defensively (the floor's `overflow: hidden` clips visually so spec's "no maximum" rule is honoured by the floor, not the vessel). When `size.h` is set, the chassis takes a fixed height and the body becomes `overflow-y: auto` so cards scroll inside; without `h`, the vessel grows with content as before.

**Gesture independence.** The resize handle calls `event.stopPropagation()` on pointerdown and the vessel's translation drag is gated by `dragControls.start()` from the name label only — the two gestures don't interfere.

Skipped intentionally: pinch-to-resize (touch — deferred per ADR §5), corner-handle visibility on hover only (the handle stays present and quiet, in keeping with workspace-as-physical-space), per-density default sizes (size is freeform until density gestures arrive), aspect-ratio lock (spec implies free resize), keyboard equivalents for resize (deferred per ADR §6 a11y floor), no-overlap collision detection (still a later slice — vessels can overlap when resized large), default-size recompute on viewport resize, server-side persistence.

### Slice 5c — vessel brightness, density, orientation (2026-05-01)

The three remaining per-feed attentional axes per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"Feed scope" come online. Brightness changes the resolved colour palette (walls, interior, name label, cards). Density changes the card grammar inside (compact / standard / full). Orientation toggles the chassis between vertical (⊔: left + right + bottom walls) and horizontal (⊏: top + left + bottom walls, opening on the right; cards lay out in a row, horizontal scroll if w/h fixed).

**Tokens consolidated.** New `web/src/components/workspace/tokens.ts` exports `Brightness | Density | Orientation` + a `PALETTES: Record<Brightness, VesselPalette>` lookup keyed on the wireframe's committed primary / medium / dim colour tables (incl. desaturated crimson `#C4545A` and `pipOpacity: 0.7` at dim). Three small `next*` cycle helpers. The chassis resolves a single `palette` and passes `brightness` + `density` down to cards; cards re-render at the right brightness/density without per-card token plumbing beyond the two props.

**Store changes (`useWorkspace`).** `VesselLayout` extends with optional `brightness`, `density`, `orientation`. Three new setters (`setVesselBrightness` / `setVesselDensity` / `setVesselOrientation`) merge into the existing per-feed record under the same `workspace:layout:<userId>` storage key, debounced 200ms. Slice-5a / 5b values read forward unchanged because every new axis is optional with a per-axis default (medium / standard / vertical).

**Vessel changes (`Vessel.tsx`).** Accepts the three new props + commit callbacks. Wall arrangement branches on orientation. Inner flex direction switches between `column` and `row`; height-set vessels now scroll on the active axis (vertical → `overflow-y`, horizontal → `overflow-x`). Three small cycle controls (mono-glyph buttons) appear pinned to the chassis bottom-right just left of the resize handle: `○|◐|●` for brightness, `c|s|f` for density, `||─` for orientation. Each click cycles forward; `title` carries the full label so the abbreviations stay discoverable. Per ADR §5 these are the desktop alternatives to the touch gestures (two-finger vertical drag for brightness, two-finger rotation for orientation, gestural density toggle) — the cycle buttons are honest about discreteness; when continuous brightness lands, the storage shape evolves at that point.

**Card changes (`VesselCard.tsx`).** Now accepts `density` + `brightness` props and resolves a `CardContext` carrying both. Compact density collapses the card to an inline 9px pip + single-line title (with a crimson `£` glyph for paywalled articles, no full price). Standard is the slice-1 layout. Full adds a final source-attribution row (`VIA <PROTOCOL> · <IDENTIFIER>`, mono caps 10px, quietest meta colour). All hardcoded medium-bright tokens are replaced with palette lookups, so a vessel at `dim` recolours its cards including pip opacity (0.7 per spec).

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** Plumbs the three new props from `useWorkspace` to each `Vessel`, and `density` + `brightness` from the layout to each rendered card.

Skipped intentionally: continuous brightness (touch gesture deferred per ADR §5; storage stays discrete until then), real touch gestures (two-finger vertical drag, two-finger rotation, gestural density), brightness-as-focus coupling (`WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"What this spec doesn't yet pin down" — focus mode is its own design pass), name-label repositioning to the opening side in horizontal mode (label stays above the vessel root for now; spec calls for it to follow the opening), per-density default sizes (a horizontal vessel still inherits the user's last w/h — they resize to taste), keyboard equivalents for the three controls (deferred per ADR §6 a11y floor — the cycle buttons are clickable, just not arrow-key-reachable), nine-state matrix QA across density × brightness in the live UI (the wireframe showed the nine frames pass; the runtime renderer is a first cut), no-overlap collision (still later), thumbnails / lead images at full density (the spec calls for them; `feed_items` doesn't carry them in a way the slice can render — TODO).

### Slice 6 — ∀ → *Reset workspace layout* wired (2026-05-01)

The fourth ∀ menu item stops being a `console.log` stub. The reset is layout-only — positions, sizes, brightness, density, orientation — and never touches `feeds` or `feed_sources`. Feeds and their sources survive the reset.

**Surface.** New `web/src/components/workspace/ResetLayoutConfirm.tsx` matches the scrim/panel grammar of `NewFeedPrompt` (40% scrim, 420px panel, hairline black border, 144px top inset). Body copy adapts to vessel count: zero-vessel state describes the wipe abstractly; ≥1 promises *N vessels* will return to the default grid. The confirm button is crimson (`#B5242A`) and auto-focuses on open — destructive-flavoured even though the operation is non-destructive in the data sense, because committed layout is genuinely irrecoverable. Cancel / Esc / scrim-click closes.

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** New `resetConfirmOpen` flag. `ForallAction === 'reset'` opens the modal; on confirm `handleResetLayout` calls `useWorkspace.reset()` *and immediately re-seeds default grid slots for the current vessels in their existing order* via `defaultGridSlot(i, viewportWidth)`. Without the re-seed the vessels would collapse to `(0, 0)` for one paint while the bootstrap default-slot effect didn't re-run (it's keyed on `user`, not on `positions`). Re-seeding inside the same handler keeps the floor visually continuous through the reset.

**Store (`useWorkspace.reset()`).** Already existed from slice 5a — set `positions: {}`, schedule a localStorage write of the empty object. No changes this slice.

Skipped intentionally: undo (one-shot toast offering *Undo reset* would need a snapshot of the pre-reset map; the modal is the friction layer for now), reset-only-this-vessel (per-vessel context menu, deferred with rename/delete), keyboard shortcut (the ∀ menu's Enter-on-item is the keyboard path), animation on the re-seed (vessels snap to grid; with Framer Motion's `layout` prop this could tween, but the resize/rotate slices haven't pulled in `layoutId` yet).

### Slice 7 — vessel rename + delete UI (2026-05-01)

The two slice-3 routes that had no surface — `PATCH /api/v1/workspace/feeds/:id` and `DELETE /api/v1/workspace/feeds/:id` — light up. Both gestures hang off `FeedComposer`'s header / footer rather than introducing a per-vessel context menu (which would need the long-press / right-click gesture system not yet built).

**Rename (header).** The static name in the composer header swaps to a `Rename` mono-caps button next to the name. Click → inline input pre-filled with the current name (auto-selected for fast retype), `Save` and `Cancel` buttons inline. Enter saves; Esc cancels. Validates 1–80 chars, trim-equal-to-current = no-op close. On success the composer reflects the new name and `onRenamed(feed)` fires up to `WorkspaceView` which patches the matching `vessels[].feed` so the vessel name label updates without a refetch.

**Delete (footer).** A new bottom row separated by hairline, with a single `Delete feed` mono-caps button at right (grey → crimson on hover). Click → swaps in-place to a two-step confirm row: hint *Delete this feed? Sources are removed; subscriptions are kept.* + `Cancel` + crimson `Delete`. The two-step in-panel confirm is lighter than `ResetLayoutConfirm`'s modal because the action is feed-scoped (one row to undo by re-creating) rather than workspace-scoped.

**Last-feed guard.** `WorkspaceView` passes `deleteBlocked={vessels.length <= 1}`; in that case the footer renders a hint reading *Can't delete your only feed — create another first.* in place of the delete button. Without the guard, a sole-feed delete would leave the floor visibly empty until the next bootstrap reseeded a default — an awkward hidden recovery path. The gateway `DELETE /workspace/feeds/:id` would happily delete it; the FE-only guard is the friction layer.

**Subscription preservation.** The composer's hint copy (*subscriptions are kept*) names the deliberate behaviour from slice 4: deleting a feed cascades to its `feed_sources` rows but leaves any underlying `external_subscriptions` rows intact. The user can keep the subscription via `/subscriptions` or reuse the source on another feed.

**Layout cleanup.** On delete, `onDeleted(feedId)` drops the vessel from `vessels` *and* calls `useWorkspace.removeVessel(feedId)` so the localStorage layout entry doesn't accumulate stale records. The store method already existed from slice 5a; this is its first wired caller.

Skipped intentionally: undo-delete toast (would need an in-memory snapshot of the deleted feed + its sources, plus a re-create endpoint that preserves IDs — not worth it for an experiment), per-vessel rename via long-press / context menu (the gesture system is its own slice), confirm-on-rename (rename is reversible — the user can rename back), keyboard shortcut for Rename (the button is reachable via Tab inside the composer; the workspace a11y floor per ADR §6 doesn't require a dedicated shortcut), animated removal of the vessel from the floor (Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` will arrive with the ∀→H→⊔ ceremony slice).

### Slice 8 — ∀ → *Fork feed by URL* wired (2026-05-01)

The third ∀ stub goes live. *Fork feed by URL* is a one-gesture combo of *create feed* + *add first source* + *open vessel*, sharing the universal-resolver input grammar from `FeedComposer`'s "Add a source" but minting a fresh feed each time.

**Surface (`web/src/components/workspace/ForkFeedPrompt.tsx`).** New component. Same scrim/panel grammar as `NewFeedPrompt` (40% scrim, 480px panel, hairline black border, 144px top inset). Single input — *Paste a URL, @username, npub, DID, or #tag* — that resolver-debounces (300ms + Phase B polling, context `subscribe`). Match candidates render below as a list of mono-caps-sublabelled buttons; clicking one performs the fork. Tag fallback for `#name` inputs mirrors `FeedComposer`. Hint copy under the input names the gesture's outcome: *Picks something below to mint a new feed pointed at it. Rename later from the feed composer.*

**Fork mechanics.** `handleFork(opt)` runs `workspaceFeedsApi.create(derivedName)` then `workspaceFeedsApi.addSource(feedId, opt.add)` in sequence. The derived name comes from the resolved match — display name → @username → URI → feed title — clamped to 80 chars. If `create` succeeds but `addSource` fails, the partial feed is *kept* and handed back via `onForked(feed)`; the modal surfaces a hint reading *Feed created but source add failed: …* so the user can finish wiring it via the feed composer rather than losing the new vessel. Roll-forward over rollback because the feed itself is salvageable state.

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** New `forkOpen` flag. `ForallAction === 'fork'` opens the modal; `handleForked(feed)` mirrors `handleCreateFeed` — appends the vessel, writes a default-grid slot via `setVesselPosition`, fires `loadVesselItems(feed)`. The user lands on a vessel that already shows the source's content on first paint (modulo backfill latency for newly-subscribed external sources).

**Why "fork" not "subscribe".** The menu copy uses *fork* because the verb in this branch's vocabulary is workspace-floor-shaped: *fork* makes a new vessel from an external thing the way a software fork makes a new repo from a remote one. Subscribing to a single source from `/subscriptions` (which still exists as the Phase 1–4 surface) is a different gesture with a different mental model.

Skipped intentionally: multi-source fork (the menu item is "Fork *feed* by URL"; the user mints one source at a time and adds more in `FeedComposer`), fork from clipboard (browser permission costs > value at this fidelity), recently-resolved suggestions (the resolver doesn't expose a history surface yet), import a feed-of-feeds (e.g. an OPML upload — out of scope for the workspace shell), in-place rename of the derived name *before* the fork commits (the modal's hint already promises rename-later via the feed composer; an inline rename would slow the gesture to two steps when one of the resolver matches is good enough).

### Slice 9 — ∀→H→⊔ ceremony animation (2026-05-01)

The signature visual move per `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` §"The ∀-to-H-to-⊔ transformation" + `WIREFRAME-DECISIONS-CONSOLIDATED.md` Step 9. Two paces: *ceremonial* on first-login (~2000ms, terminal state populated with card placeholders) and *responsive* on each new feed creation (~800ms — under one second per spec, terminal empty ⊔). Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` + transformable SVG primitives enter the codebase for the first time, on the back of the slice 5a `motion.div` baseline.

**Component (`web/src/components/workspace/ForallCeremony.tsx`).** A floor-relative absolutely-positioned 300×300 SVG overlay. Five phases driven by `setTimeout` boundaries off `CEREMONY_TIMINGS[pace]`: `forall` → `partingToH` → `hHold` → `crossbarDrop` → (`cards`, ceremonial only) → `done`. The ∀ glyph renders as Literata text inside the SVG, crimson `#B5242A`, scales 0.4→1 from box centre, then fades as the H bars resolve. Verticals fade in (matching the ∀'s exit), the crossbar enters at H position (mid-Y, between the verticals), then animates `(x, y, width)` to the ⊔ base position (full-width, bottom). For ceremonial pace, three white card placeholders fade in inside the resolved ⊔. `transition` uses `easeInOut` on the crossbar drop and `easeOut` on entries — snap-not-morph reads via decisive easing rather than literal stepping.

**Reduced-motion variant.** ADR §2 reserved a fade-only fallback. When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set, the component renders a static ⊔ (verticals + base) that fades in over 200ms then fires `onComplete`. No transformation, no ∀, no card snap.

**Timings (`web/src/lib/workspace/motion.ts`).** New `CeremonyTiming` interface + `CEREMONY_TIMINGS` map. Ceremonial sums to 2000ms (`forallIn 150 + forallHold 100 + partToH 150 + hHold 700 + crossbarDrop 350 + cardsSnap 350 + settle 200`). Responsive sums to 740ms with `cardsSnap = 0`. The `hHold = 700` honours the spec's "the slowest moment — held for ~600ms" framing for the ceremonial pace.

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** New `ceremony: PendingCeremony | null` state. `handleCreateFeed` and `handleForked` both:
1. POST → mint feed
2. Compute destination grid slot via `defaultGridSlot(...)`
3. Append vessel + write position to the layout store *immediately* — items fetch starts behind the curtain
4. Set `ceremony = { feedId, pace: 'responsive', target: slot }`
5. On ceremony `onComplete` → clear `ceremony` (vessel becomes visible)

The first-login path is gated in the bootstrap effect: when the feed list is empty AND a `workspace:ceremony_seen:<userId>` localStorage flag is unset, the ceremony queues at viewport-centred coordinates with `pace: 'ceremonial'`, and the seen flag writes on completion. The flag survives logouts on the same browser; a returning user with zero feeds (e.g. they deleted everything) does not get the ceremonial pace again — it's an onboarding moment, not a fallback.

**Vessel hidden during ceremony (`Vessel.tsx`).** New `hidden?: boolean` prop sets `opacity: 0` + `pointerEvents: 'none'` on the `motion.div`. The vessel still mounts so its items query lands during the ceremony — for an 800ms responsive pace this hides ~500ms of LOADING… that would otherwise follow the ceremony. The visible ⊔ during animation is the ceremony overlay; on `onComplete` the overlay unmounts and the vessel reveals with content already in place (or close to it).

**Position discontinuity (first-login).** The ceremonial pace plays viewport-centred per spec ("expands from the centre of an empty screen"), but the founder's feed mounts at its grid slot — so when the ceremony completes, the ⊔ "appears" in the corner rather than gliding from centre to slot. The spec describes a continuous resolve into resting position; sliding the SVG across the floor to terminate exactly on the destination chassis is a polish slice, not slice 9. The current jump is brief and the eye reads it as the ceremony giving way to the workspace, not as a glitch.

Skipped intentionally: the slide-from-centre-to-corner choreography for first-login (the ceremonial pace's terminal position currently doesn't match the eventual founder's-feed grid slot — a continuous transit is its own animation slice with `layoutId` plumbing that's not in service yet), card content during the ceremonial cards phase (the placeholders are blank rectangles — title/standfirst lines "resolve in their final third into legible content" per spec, deferred until the cards layer can be re-used between ceremony and live render), morph-not-just-cross-fade between glyphs (true ∀→H path morphing requires either pre-baked path data or a font-as-paths pipeline; the current cross-fade reads convincingly at the durations involved), reduced-motion sliding equivalent (the fade-in is pure opacity — no traversal), per-vessel ∀→H→⊔ on subsequent reloads (intentionally one-shot — the ceremony is a transit, not a category), audio cue / haptic.

### Slice 10 — Composer article mode + 400-word note→article nudge (2026-05-01)

`Composer` becomes the single composing surface for both notes and articles, per `WIREFRAME-DECISIONS-CONSOLIDATED.md` Step 6. Note mode (slices 2.5–2.8) is unchanged; article mode adds a TipTap-backed editing surface, title + dek + publication selector + paywall toolbar, and the 400-word elevation nudge. Two entry points: ∀ → *Write an article* (direct), and the in-composer *Write an article →* link (or 400-word nudge) from note mode (elevation).

**Mode state.** `Composer` gains `mode: 'note' | 'article'` + `initialMode?: ComposerMode` prop. Mode is local to the component and resets on every open. The retired `stores/compose.ts` stays untouched — workspace-scope compose state is still component-local until a second open-as-article entry point exists (e.g. quote-as-article from a card).

**TipTap.** A single `useEditor` instance is mounted up-front while the Composer is open (extensions: `StarterKit` with H2/H3, `Markdown`, `Image`, `ImageUpload`, `EmbedNode`, `PaywallGateNode`, `Placeholder`, `CharacterCount`). It survives a note→article elevation in-place. The textarea-based note mode is preserved as-is — switching to article mode lazy-populates the editor with the textarea content via `editor.commands.setContent(initialBody, false)`. A heading-prefixed first line (`# …`) is promoted to the title field, matching the spec's *"Pre-populated if note content began with a heading"*. The elevation is one-way per slice 10: there's no *back to note* affordance, because the note's plain-text + char-count semantics aren't expressible in TipTap state without lossy round-tripping.

**Article-mode chrome.** New zones top-down per spec:
1. Title — Literata serif italic 22px on `bg-grey-100` (`#F0EFEB`) field.
2. Standfirst — Literata serif italic 15px, `Standfirst (optional)` placeholder.
3. *Publish as* selector — `<select>` defaulting to `PERSONAL`. Populates from `publications.myMemberships()` pre-fetched on open. Memberships without `can_publish` annotate the option label `(review)` and the publish button flips to `Submit for review`.
4. Toolbar — `B · I · H2 · H3 · " · IMG | PAYWALL`. PAYWALL is the only crimson-accented item; toggling inserts/removes the `paywallGate` node via the existing TipTap commands.
5. Editor surface — `EditorContent` on `bg-grey-100` with `min-height: 320` and a `max-height: calc(100vh - 480px)` scroll cap so the panel never exceeds viewport.
6. Price row — appears only when the gate is inserted. £-prefixed numeric input + word count + read-time readout.

**Hint copy + button.** Bottom row in article mode reads `N words · M min read[ · Saved]`. Person chips in the To field disable publish with *Articles can't be sent privately — remove person chips to publish.* The Publish button is crimson `#B5242A` in article mode (matches the wireframe's *publish button turns crimson*); label flips to `Submit for review` for memberships without `can_publish`.

**Publish path.** `handlePublishArticle` builds a `PublishData` from the editor's markdown (split at `PAYWALL_GATE_MARKER` if the gate is inserted, with `gatePositionPct` computed from the free/paywall ratio) and dispatches:
- `publishToPublication(publicationId, data)` if a publication is selected — server-side pipeline via `gateway/publications/:id/articles`. Same path the legacy `/write?pub=…` form uses.
- `publishArticle(data, user.pubkey)` for `PERSONAL` — client-side pipeline (sign v1, index, encrypt v2 if paywalled, sign v2, re-index). Same path the legacy `/write` form uses.

The composer doesn't reimplement either pipeline — both helpers in `web/src/lib/publish.ts` are reused. Tags, scheduling, comments toggle, and `showOnWriterProfile` defer to defaults (`tags: []`, no schedule, comments-on, profile-on); per spec these "defer to the full editor" until polished into the panel. The legacy `/write` page survives unchanged as the deep-link form for resume + edit + schedule + tags-rich flows.

**Draft autosave.** The TipTap `onUpdate` hook calls `createAutoSaver(3000)` with the current title/dek/content/price. Autosave is gated on a non-empty title — `saveDraft` requires it server-side. Draft status (`Saved` / `Save failed`) appears inline in the bottom hint row for ~2s.

**Cross-protocol broadcast in article mode.** Hidden — the *Send via* row only renders when `mode === 'note' && chips.length === 0`. The article path always anchors on Nostr (kind 30023) with no atproto/activitypub fan-out. Cross-posting articles to ActivityPub or Bluesky is its own slice (the Bluesky/Mastodon outbound paths key on a Nostr kind-1 source event; articles are kind 30023 and would need their own routing through `outbound_posts.action_type = 'original'` plus a per-protocol body shape decision — defer until users actually ask for it).

**400-word nudge.** New `web/src/components/workspace/Composer.tsx` local state `nudgeDismissed` + `showNudge`. While in note mode, an effect counts whitespace-split words and shows an inline panel reading *This is getting long. Switch to article mode?* with `Switch` (crimson) and `Dismiss` (grey) buttons. Threshold is 400 words per spec. Dismissal is per-Composer-session (resets on close/reopen). The nudge is a one-shot panel rather than a recurring toast — once dismissed, it stays gone for the rest of the open session even as the user keeps typing.

**∀ menu fifth item.** `ForallMenu` adds `'new-article'` after `'new-note'` with label *Write an article*. `WorkspaceView.composerOpen` becomes `false | 'note' | 'article'` so the same Composer instance can open in either mode. Mode resets on open via the `initialMode` prop.

**`/write` page survives.** The route still serves the long-form editor (full toolbar, tags, scheduling, edit-published-article via `?edit=`, draft resumption via `?draft=`). It's no longer the *only* way to write an article — the workspace Composer covers fresh-publish + paywall-gate + publication routing for the common case — but the Migration Map's "undecided" verdict on `/write` resolves provisionally as **survives as deep-link form** (per Open Item §5.6).

Skipped intentionally: schedule button (no draft-then-schedule UI in the panel; falls back to `/write?draft=…` if the user wants to schedule), tag input (Wireframe Step 6 doesn't list it among article-mode zones; tags survive on `/write`), comments toggle, *show on writer profile* toggle for publication articles, edit-published-article from the workspace (the panel only knows fresh-publish; editing routes to `/write?edit=…`), draft resumption (the panel always opens fresh — opening a saved draft routes to `/write?draft=…`), embed toolbar button (simpler IMG-only toolbar this slice), price suggestion based on word count (the legacy `/write` has it; defer until the panel sees real use), publish-confirmation panel with email-subscribers checkbox (slice goes straight from Publish click to publish; the confirm/email flow is per spec but adds a step that didn't fit the workspace's *gesture is the publish* feel — revisit), back-to-note from article mode (one-way elevation), TipTap-as-note-mode (the textarea stays — note→article is a real mode change with content carry-over, not a chrome change over a single editor), 760px article-mode width per the legacy ALLHAUS spec (kept at 640 for both modes; revisit if the article surface feels cramped). Cross-posting articles to ActivityPub / Bluesky and the article→DM "private article" gesture remain explicitly out of scope.

### Slice 11 — card click-through + action strip + reply context (2026-05-01)

Vessels stop being read-only display surfaces. Cards click through to the reader, gain a quiet `vote · reply · share` strip under the body in standard / full density, and the *Reply* gesture finally gives `Composer` its second open-the-composer entry point. The `useWorkspaceCompose` extraction the slice-2.5 build log forecasted is *not* built — `WorkspaceView`-local state (`composerOpen` + `replyTarget`) is enough for the two entry points (∀ menu and card-action-strip Reply); a store extraction can wait until a third entry point arrives.

**Card click-through.** `VesselCard` accepts an optional `onClick` on `CardShell`. Articles route to `/article/[dTag]` via `useRouter().push` (the carry-over reader, per Migration Map §1). Externals open `sourceItemUri` in a new tab — atproto URIs first translate to `bsky.app` via a local `atprotoWebUri` helper that mirrors the one in the deprecated `feed/ExternalCard.tsx` (kept duplicated rather than promoting to a shared util because the deprecated card retires before any merge to master). Notes don't navigate — there's no `/note/[id]` route in the workspace world, and the existing inline reply thread in `feed/NoteCard` is part of the deprecated chassis. Notes stay read-in-place; the action strip provides the only interaction.

**Action strip (`CardActions`).** Mono-caps 11px row pinned under the card body in standard / full density, suppressed in compact (compact is intentionally a single-line title — adding a six-glyph action row defeats the density). Three slots:
- `VoteControls` — reused from `web/src/components/ui/VoteControls.tsx` unchanged. Vote target is the Nostr event id + kind (30023 for articles, 1 for notes). Externals don't render vote controls — vote tallies are bound to a native event id and external items don't have one. The component lazy-fetches its own tallies / my-votes via `votesApi`, so the strip stays cheap to render across many cards (per-vessel up to 12 cards × N vessels). A future optimisation could batch-load tallies with the items query, but the current per-card load is fine at slice-11 traffic.
- `Reply` button — fires `onReply(replyTarget)` up to `WorkspaceView`, which sets the reply target and opens the composer. Suppressed for externals (cross-protocol replies are deferred per ADR open question + UNIVERSAL-FEED-ADR — the slice doesn't try to wire them).
- `Share` button — copies a deep link to clipboard (`window.location.origin + /article/<dTag>` for articles; `sourceItemUri` for externals). No toast confirmation this slice; users see the cursor land back on the card. A small "Copied" affordance is its own polish.

Click bubbling: `CardActions` calls `e.stopPropagation()` on its container so vote / reply / share clicks don't fall through to the card-level `onClick` and trigger an unwanted navigation.

**Drag vs click.** Vessels initiate drag only from the name label (`dragControls.start(event)` on `onPointerDown` of the `<button>` / `<div>` name label, with `dragListener={false}` on the parent `motion.div`). Cards inside the vessel are not drag handles, so card clicks are safe — no need for a `dragMovedRef`-style suppression on the card layer.

**`Composer.replyTarget`.** New optional `ReplyTarget` prop (`{ eventId, eventKind, authorPubkey, authorName, excerpt? }`) exported from `Composer.tsx`. When set:
- Mode locks to `note` regardless of `initialMode` (article-mode replies aren't a thing).
- The `Publishing publicly` banner + To-field + protocol selector + *Write an article →* link are all hidden. The cleanly-removed surface is replaced with a *Replying to NAME — excerpt* header in the slice-10 banner-bg grammar (mono-caps name, italic Literata excerpt).
- `handlePublishNote` branches: a reply payload routes through the existing `web/src/lib/replies.ts::publishReply` (NIP-10 e+p tags, `/api/v1/replies` index endpoint) rather than `publishNote`. The reply pipeline is fully reused — the new path is a four-line branch in `Composer.handlePublishNote`. No new endpoints, no new tags, no new tag conventions.
- Button label flips to `Reply` / `Replying…`. Hint row drops to the bare `N/1000` char count.
- Char limit stays at 1000; reply-only `parentCommentEventId` (for nested-thread context) is *not* supported this slice — only top-level replies to a card. Threaded replies on the workspace are their own slice (the playscript thread render pattern from `web/src/components/replies/PlayscriptThread.tsx` survives per Migration Map §2 *replies/* but isn't yet wired into the vessel surface).

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** New `replyTarget: ReplyTarget | null` state. The ∀ menu's *new note* / *new article* paths clear it; the card action strip's `onReply` sets it + opens the composer in note mode. `Composer.onClose` clears both `composerOpen` and `replyTarget` so the next ∀ → *New note* doesn't accidentally inherit a stale reply context.

**Cross-checks against the design corpus.** The card grammar in `CARDS-AND-PIP-PANEL-HANDOFF.md` calls for a unified action strip — slice 11 ships `Reply · Vote · Share` and defers `Save` (the per-feed save mechanism is its own gesture, listed in §"Deferred" below). The `BookmarkButton` retires per Migration Map §2 (cross-feed bookmarks dropped); slice 11 doesn't reintroduce it under another name. Trust pip remains inline (non-tappable) — the pip panel is its own slice, listed below.

Skipped intentionally: pip panel as tap target on the inline pip (slice 12 territory — needs trust polling preview UI, FOLLOW + SUBSCRIBE rows), nested-thread reply context (`parentCommentEventId` + `parentCommentId`), reply count badge on cards (the existing `/api/v1/replies` count endpoint is there; rendering it on every card was deemed visual noise without the playscript thread to drop into), in-card playscript thread expansion (slice 13+), Save action on the strip (per-feed save is the right model per spec but needs schema), share-toast affordance, tap-to-quote (`Quote` was on the pre-workspace card strip; the workspace's quote story routes through the resolver-driven Composer with a quoted-event tag and is its own slice), batch vote tally pre-loading on the items endpoint, click-through for notes (no `/note/[id]` route — surfaces in a future slice that decides between modal-thread and dedicated route), cross-protocol reply on external cards (Bluesky reply via linked atproto account etc. — Migration Map §5 #11), keyboard equivalent for the action strip (per ADR §6 a11y floor — the buttons are Tab-reachable since they're in the natural DOM order, just not chord-shortcutted), `/article/[dTag]` reading-mode-vs-arranging-mode coupling (still URL navigation — `WORKSPACE-DESIGN-SPEC.md` open Q remains deferred).

### Slice 12 — pip panel (first cut) (2026-05-01)

The TrustPip stops being inert. Tapping the pip on a native (note / article) card opens a popover with header, bio, a first-cut trust signals block, and a SUBSCRIBE footer when the writer offers subscriptions. Per `CARDS-AND-PIP-PANEL-HANDOFF.md` §"The pip panel" the panel is the *judgment + commitment* surface — slice 12 ships *commitment* (FOLLOW + SUBSCRIBE link) in full and ships *judgment* as a placeholder until the polling backend exists.

**Trigger surface (`PipTrigger`).** New thin wrapper around `TrustPip` that turns the inline pip into a button. Click `stopPropagation`s so the card-level navigation (`onClick` on `CardShell`) doesn't fire on the same gesture. The button measures its own bounding rect and hands `(pubkey, rect, status)` up to `WorkspaceView` so a single shared `PipPanel` instance can anchor on whichever pip was tapped. Compact-density rendering keeps the slice-5c 0.82× scale via the pip code's existing transform path; this slice didn't touch the bare `TrustPip` component.

**Native vs external.** Article + note cards render `PipTrigger`; external cards keep the bare `TrustPip` because external authors don't have a platform user id and `gateway/src/routes/trust.ts::GET /trust/:userId` keys on user id. Cross-protocol pip panels (showing trust info for a Bluesky author seen via Jetstream) is its own slice — needs federation-side identity resolution that doesn't exist yet.

**Panel surface (`PipPanel.tsx`).** Fixed-position popover, ~420px wide, anchored below-and-right of the pip when there's room, otherwise above. Outside-pointerdown + Esc close. Z-index 70 (above the floor + cards but below the workspace ∀ menu's potential modal — none currently in flight at z 60+ except `Composer`'s 60, so 70 keeps the panel above an inadvertently-still-open composer). Material is the slice-1 white panel + hairline black border + soft shadow grammar — matches `NewFeedPrompt` / `ForkFeedPrompt` / `Composer`.

**Header.** Large pip (1.4× transform of the inline pip) · author name in Literata medium 18px with a `›` glyph chevron (the name+chevron is a `next/link` to `/<username>` — the carry-over writer profile route per Migration Map §1) · right-aligned `FOLLOW ›` / `FOLLOWING ›` (mono-caps, text-only, no button chrome — matches the handoff doc's "rejected: making FOLLOW an inverted block button" note). The author's-own-pip suppresses the FOLLOW button (you can't follow yourself).

**Bio line.** Literata regular 14px, plain weight, from the writer's `accounts.bio` field via the existing `GET /writers/by-pubkey/<pubkey>` route. Rendered only if non-empty — empty bio gets clean omission rather than a placeholder.

**TRUST section (first cut).** Renders the existing `trust_layer1` signals — `accountAgeDays`, `articleCount`, `payingReaderCount`, `nip05Verified`, `paymentVerified` — as a five-row mono-caps right-aligned-value list. Honest about what's missing: a small Literata italic line below reads *Polling questions land in a future slice.* The handoff doc's three poll questions (*Are they human? · Are they who they seem to be? · Do they engage in good faith?*) need a polling backend that doesn't exist (`docs/adr/ALLHAUS-OMNIBUS.md` §III.7 frames this as trust-system-spec-proper territory). Layer 1 signals are a real-data surface for the same question — *what does the system know about this author?* — and ship in advance of the polling system rather than blocking the panel's other elements.

**VOLUME section.** Skipped this slice. The handoff calls for a five-step horizontal volume bar with a RANDOM/TOP sampling toggle — both surface and persistence. Per ADR §3 *Saved items: defer. Stub in code, no schema until the surface design solidifies.* Volume settings are in the same category — they're per-user-per-author state, no schema, and the bar's interaction model needs a proper design pass (continuous drag vs discrete steps; the touch gesture deferred per ADR §5; the `RANDOM` vs `TOP` semantics from the handoff's open architectural questions). Slice 12 leaves the section out entirely rather than ship a non-functional placeholder; it returns when the schema lands.

**SUBSCRIBE footer.** Right-aligned mono-caps crimson `SUBSCRIBE · £X.XX/MO ›` link to `/<username>` when `subscription_price_pence > 0`. The actual subscribe gesture lives on the writer's profile page (per handoff: "subscribing is the action; managing an existing subscription is on the author's profile or account page"). The panel's footer is the entry point, not the form. `SUBSCRIBED — MANAGE ›` for active subscriptions is deferred — needs a per-pubkey subscription-status check from `/api/v1/subscriptions/mine` that wasn't worth threading for this slice.

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** New shared `pipPanel: { pubkey, status, rect } | null` state. Card `onPipOpen` sets it; the panel's `onClose` clears it. A one-shot `followsApi.listPubkeys()` call on workspace mount populates a `Set<string>` of the user's followed pubkeys; the panel reads its initial follow state from this set rather than each open firing its own membership check. `onFollowChanged` mutates the set so the next open of the same pip reflects the new state. The set isn't refetched after panel close — the canonical state is on the gateway, but for the workspace's lifecycle this approach matches the localStorage-first ethos of slice 5a (best-effort cache, optimistic updates).

**Follows API (`web/src/lib/api/follows.ts`).** New module with `listPubkeys / follow / unfollow`. Matches the existing `client.request<T>` pattern; re-exported from `web/src/lib/api.ts` facade. Mostly a tidy-up — `FollowingTab.tsx` was hitting `/api/v1/follows/...` via raw `fetch` because no namespace existed.

Skipped intentionally: VOLUME bar (no schema; needs polling-spec-proper-adjacent design pass), the three-poll-question UI (no polling backend), in-person count line (no `encounter` data exposure), subscribed-state detection in the footer (`SUBSCRIBED — MANAGE ›`), pip panel in non-green states (the four-state pip mapping per handoff §"Trust section" needs the polling result composition function — `ALLHAUS-OMNIBUS` §III.7 + open question), pip panel on mobile (sheet-from-bottom; ADR §5 mobile defer), block / mute (block lives elsewhere per handoff §"What the panel does NOT carry"; mute = 0% volume so retires with the volume bar's arrival), `ALL POLLING ›` depth affordance (needs the trust-detail surface), pip panel for external authors (cross-protocol identity resolution), focus management / focus trap inside the panel (the workspace a11y floor per ADR §6 keeps this minimal — Esc + outside-click close suffice), aria-expanded state on the trigger button, animated open/close (the panel snaps; Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` could tween but the popover's small surface makes it unnecessary for now).

### Slice 13 — inline playscript thread on vessel cards (2026-05-02)

The slice 11 build log flagged `web/src/components/replies/PlayscriptThread.tsx` as surviving Migration Map §2 *replies/* but not yet wired into the vessel surface. Slice 13 wires it. Native cards (article + note) gain a `Thread` toggle in the action strip; tapping it expands an inline playscript directly under the card body.

**No new component.** `ReplySection` (the existing source-of-truth for tree fetch + flatten-to-playscript + reply-publish + vote-tally batching) is reused unchanged in shape. The slice adds a single new prop — `refreshKey?: number` — to its existing useEffect deps so an external publish path (the slice-11 overlay Composer) can nudge a refetch without remounting. `compact` (already supported) suppresses the section's own border-top + heading so the embed reads as part of the card.

**Surface (`VesselCard.tsx`).** `CardActions` gains an optional `Thread` button after `Reply` — text-only mono-caps in the strip's grey, label flips to `Hide thread` when expanded. Compact density still skips the action row entirely; the toggle is suppressed there. A new `CardThread` wrapper renders `ReplySection` inline and click-isolates the subtree (`onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`) so taps inside the thread don't bubble up to the card-level navigation. External cards don't render the toggle — `/api/v1/replies` keys on a native event id and the cross-protocol reply story is still deferred.

**State (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** Two new pieces: `expandedThreads: Set<string>` (which event ids are open) and `threadRefreshTicks: Record<string, number>` (per-target counter bumped after an overlay-Composer reply lands). Toggle handler flips membership; the slice-11 overlay Reply path stays as the *fast* compose surface, but its reply-publish now also auto-expands the affected card's thread and bumps the tick so the new reply is immediately visible.

**`Composer.onReplied`.** New optional callback fires only on the reply branch of `handlePublishNote` (the four-line branch added in slice 11). Distinct from `onPublished` because note/article publishes refresh every vessel's items query, while reply publishes only need the affected card's thread to refetch.

**Brightness coverage.** ReplySection's hardcoded greys (text-grey-200, text-grey-300, etc.) don't recolour for dim/bright vessel palettes. Slice 13 accepts the slight palette mismatch — the playscript reads correctly, just isn't fully tokenised. Per-brightness theming for the playscript surface lives with the broader brightness × focus design pass (already deferred).

Skipped intentionally: reply count badge on the action strip (the existing `/api/v1/replies` endpoint exposes `totalCount` — surfacing it inline was deemed visual noise without a stronger reason to draw the eye to thread depth before expansion), in-thread quote-reply (the `Quote` action remains absent), nested-thread parent context beyond what the existing playscript already handles via the `→ PARENT:` line, animated expand/collapse (Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` would tween nicely but the visual snap reads fine and the workspace's animation budget is reserved for the ∀ ceremonies + drag), keyboard shortcut to toggle thread (per ADR §6 a11y floor — the button is Tab-reachable, just not chord-shortcutted), brightness-aware colour overrides for the playscript surface, share-toast affordance from inside the thread (the ReplySection still owns its own delete confirm + report — those routes remain unchanged).

### Slice 14 — pip panel VOLUME bar + per-feed-per-author commitment (2026-05-02)

Slice 12 left the VOLUME section of the pip panel out of the first cut, citing missing schema + design pending. Slice 14 ships it without a new migration — the existing `feed_sources` rows on migration 077 already have `weight`, `sampling_mode`, and `muted_at` columns reserved for exactly this purpose, and slice 4's `sourceFilteredItems` already filters on `muted_at IS NULL`. Volume becomes a thin pip-panel surface over those columns.

**Architectural call.** The handoff doc (`CARDS-AND-PIP-PANEL-HANDOFF.md` §"Open architectural questions") leaves whose-volume-applies-where unanswered: per-vessel? globally? Slice 14 decides per-vessel. The vessel *is* the per-feed surface; if you want a writer at low volume in your tech feed and high volume in your friends feed, that's the right default. Globally would conflict with the vessel-as-attentional-economy ethos.

**Routes (`gateway/src/routes/feeds.ts`).** Three new endpoints alongside the slice 4 source-CRUD surface:
- `GET /workspace/feeds/:id/author-volume/:pubkey` — read. Looks up `accounts.nostr_pubkey = $pubkey`, finds the matching `feed_sources` account row for that feed, returns `{ accountId, step, sampling, muted }`. `step = null` when there's no row (passive default — no commitment yet).
- `PUT /workspace/feeds/:id/author-volume/:pubkey { step: 0..5, sampling: 'random' | 'top' }` — upsert via `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (feed_id, account_id) WHERE source_type = 'account' DO UPDATE` against the existing partial unique index. Step 0 sets `muted_at = now()`; steps 1–5 clear `muted_at` and set `weight` per a five-bucket lookup (`[1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0]` keyed by step). Step 3's weight matches the `feed_sources.weight DEFAULT 1.0` so a passive→committed-at-3 transition doesn't change ranking once weight is wired.
- `DELETE /workspace/feeds/:id/author-volume/:pubkey` — clears the row (back to passive). Unknown-author DELETE returns 204 rather than 404 because the only client gesture is *clear commitment*, and a missing row already represents the cleared state.

**Sampling mapping.** The route's `'random'` ⇔ `feed_sources.sampling_mode = 'random'`, `'top'` ⇔ `'scored'`. The third existing value `'chronological'` is the hidden default, matching what slice 4's items query actually does today; the bar UI doesn't surface it.

**Surface (`PipPanel.tsx`).** New `feedId?: string` prop. When set on a non-self panel, a `VolumeBar` section renders below the trust signals: a six-button row (× mute, then steps 1..5), a `CLEAR` link to return to passive, and a RANDOM/TOP toggle (visible only at step ≥1, where sampling is meaningful). Active steps fill in solid black; mute is solid crimson; passive (no commitment) renders all empty. Optimistic local state with a refetch-on-failure recovery path. Hint copy below the bar adapts: passive → "Default — no commitment yet"; muted → "Muted in this feed"; committed → "Weight is recorded; ranking by volume lands when the items query honours weight" (honest about the deferred ranking story).

**Wiring (`WorkspaceView.tsx`).** The existing `pipPanel` state gains `feedId: string` (the vessel the click came from); the per-card `onPipOpen` curry now passes `v.feed.id`. New `onVolumeChanged` callback on `PipPanel` triggers `loadVesselItems(target.feed)` so a freshly-muted author drops from the visible card set without a manual reload — the items query already filters muted sources.

**Why no new table.** Reusing `feed_sources` keeps the items query consistent across slices: an author is a tracked source whether the user added them via the source composer (slice 4) or via the volume bar's first-step commitment. The two surfaces author the same row shape. A separate `feed_author_overrides` table would have required a parallel mute filter in the items query and an extra precedence rule between two separate weight columns.

**Web client (`web/src/lib/api/feeds.ts`).** New `workspaceFeedsApi.getAuthorVolume / setAuthorVolume / clearAuthorVolume` plus the `AuthorVolume` type. Standard `client.request` shape; re-exported from the api facade.

Skipped intentionally: ranking-by-weight in the items query (still chronological per slice 4 — wiring weight into the SQL is the larger ranking story), volume bar on external cards (no native account_id; cross-protocol pip panels are deferred), keyboard equivalents for the bar (per ADR §6 a11y floor), continuous (drag-to-set) volume (touch gesture + fine resolution storage; the discrete five-step buckets match the wireframe and the storage shape is forward-compatible), volume bar in the author's own pip panel (you can't set commitment for yourself), per-source-not-just-author volume (a publication source has weight too — the source composer already shows it as a column, but the surface-side dial belongs in the source composer not the pip panel), TOP-mode metric definition (the route accepts the value; the ranking semantics defer with the items-query-honours-weight slice), bulk import / import follows-as-volume-set, undo-clear toast.

### Slice 15 — three-question polls + minimal polling backend (2026-05-02)

The pip panel's TRUST section becomes load-bearing for the spec's three questions per `CARDS-AND-PIP-PANEL-HANDOFF.md` §"Trust section":
1. *Are they human?*
2. *Are they who they seem to be?*
3. *Do they engage in good faith?*

**Honesty about anonymity.** ADR-OMNIBUS §III.7 frames trust polling as anonymous via a separate attestation service that doesn't see session data. Slice 15 *does not* build that pipeline. It ships a non-anonymous `respondent_id` in the row so writes are attributable at the database level. The route shape mitigates: `GET /trust/polls/:userId` only ever surfaces aggregate counts + the viewer's own row — no other respondent's identity is reachable through any panel-side path. The honest framing is *minimal polling backend, not anonymous polling backend*. The attestation-service rewrite replaces the table when it lands; the client UI is already shaped for aggregate-only reads, so no panel work is wasted.

**Schema (migration 078).** `trust_polls(id, respondent_id, subject_id, question, answer, created_at, updated_at)`. `question` is one of `humanity / authenticity / good_faith`; `answer` is `yes / no`. UNIQUE on `(respondent_id, subject_id, question)` so re-answers upsert. `CHECK (respondent_id != subject_id)` — you don't poll yourself. Index on `(subject_id, question)` for the aggregate read. `updated_at` trigger on edit.

**Question naming choice.** The handoff intentionally distinguishes the three poll questions from the four `vouches` dimensions (humanity, encounter, identity, integrity). `humanity` overlaps; `authenticity` ("who they seem to be") is *deliberately weaker* than the formal `identity` vouch dimension; `good_faith` is the behavioural-honesty question the handoff explicitly defends as *not* the abstract `integrity`. New names rather than reusing existing dimension labels keep the two surfaces distinct in the schema, which matters when the anonymous-attestation rewrite arrives — vouches and polls have different anonymity guarantees.

**Routes (`gateway/src/routes/trust.ts`).** Three new endpoints under the existing trust router:
- `GET /trust/polls/:userId` — `optionalAuth`. Returns `{ subjectId, polls: { humanity: { yes, no, viewerAnswer }, authenticity: …, good_faith: … } }`. `viewerAnswer` is `null` for anonymous viewers or for questions the viewer hasn't answered. Two queries: a `GROUP BY question, answer` aggregate, and (when authenticated) a viewer-scoped row lookup. The shape always includes all three questions, with zero counts for ones never polled, so the client doesn't have to handle missing keys.
- `POST /trust/polls/:userId { question, answer }` — `requireAuth`. Subject-self block (`userId === respondentId` returns 400). Validates question + answer. Upsert on the unique key.
- `DELETE /trust/polls/:userId { question }` — `requireAuth`. Withdraws the viewer's row. 204 on success or no-op.

**Surface (`PipPanel.tsx`).** New `PollQuestions` component renders three rows below the Layer 1 trust signals (suppressed for the user's own pip — you don't poll yourself). Each row: Literata 13px question label · YES toggle (solid black when chosen) · NO toggle (solid crimson when chosen) · right-aligned `N%` confidence (yes-share of total, em-dash when no votes). Optimistic update on tap — the bar moves before the round-trip — with a re-fetch on failure to recover from drift. Re-tapping the viewer's current answer withdraws it (so you can change your mind, or unanswer to "don't know"). Italic Literata footnote: *Polls about &lt;name&gt; are visible only as totals — your own answer is editable.* — naming the privacy contract the route enforces. The slice 12 *Polling questions land in a future slice.* placeholder copy is gone.

**Web client (`web/src/lib/api/trust.ts`).** New `trustApi.getPolls / submitPoll / withdrawPoll` plus `PollQuestion`, `PollAnswer`, `PollAggregates`, `PollsResponse` types. Re-exported via the existing api facade.

**Pip-colour composition still deferred.** The handoff §"Trust section" + §"Open architectural questions" notes that the pip's four-state colour (green / amber / grey / crimson) should compose from the three poll results plus in-person (`encounter` vouch) count. Slice 15 ships *the data and the gesture* but doesn't change the pip's colour mapping — `trust_layer1_refresh` still drives `pip_status` purely from Layer 1 signals. Wiring poll aggregates into the pip mapping is a separate slice that owns the threshold function (the handoff calls it out as trust-system-spec-proper territory).

**Single respondent per row.** No multiple identities, no Sybil resistance, no decay. Slice 15 is the smallest possible thing that makes the panel real. The full trust system per ADR-OMNIBUS adds: anonymous attestations (encrypted to a service pubkey), graph-weighted aggregation, decay across epochs, concentration / Sybil discount factors, the humanity ratchet. None of that is in slice 15. The route shape, however, doesn't expose attribution to clients — so swapping the storage backend is a server-side replacement.

Skipped intentionally: anonymous attestation pipeline (the trust-system-proper rewrite), graph-weighted aggregation (every respondent counts equally — the handoff's "anonymous and secure, drawing on the user's trust graph and the wider network" language requires the full system), decay across time, Sybil discount, the in-person count line below the three questions (needs `vouches.dimension = 'encounter'` data piped through — separate slice), pip-colour composition from poll results (the pip still maps from Layer 1 only), `ALL POLLING ›` depth view (the handoff's extended detail surface), confidence intervals on the percentage display (the handoff calls for "high confidence" colour signalling — needs a sample-size threshold function), question-level mute (a viewer who doesn't want to opine on humanity can simply not tap; a separate "skip" affordance is unnecessary friction), poll-question version history (today's three are not necessarily the final phrasing — when they change, existing rows stay valid because the question key is the join target, not the rendered string).

## Deferred (TODO in code, not blocking the experiment)

- Trust pip colour function (signal composition rule — slice 15 ships the polling data; slice that maps polls + encounter count into the four-state pip is its own design pass).
- Save persistence (per-feed Saved state schema and surface).
- DM/messages model (vessel vs `/messages` route).
- Notifications anchor (corner pip vs ∀-menu adjunct vs vessel).
- Search entry point.
- Publications surface in workspace.
- Named audiences (FOR field) persistence + consent + management.
- Volume TOP metric definition (slice 14 records the value; ranking semantics defer with the items-query-honours-weight slice).
- Items query honouring `feed_sources.weight` (slice 14 stores it; ranking still chronological).
- Anonymous attestation pipeline (slice 15 ships attributable polls; trust-system-proper rewrites the storage backend).
- In-person count line on the pip panel (`vouches.dimension = 'encounter'` aggregate).
- Dark mode.
- "Medium-bright" pixel value.
- Cards with media (lead images, video embeds).
- Long-note truncation.
- Tags in article mode.
- Pip panel for non-green trust states (waits on the colour-composition slice).
- Cross-protocol reply semantics (slice 13 inline thread is native-only; external cards still have no Reply / Thread affordances).
- Brightness × focus coupling (also blocks per-brightness theming for the slice-13 inline playscript).
- Nudge dismissal persistence beyond session.
