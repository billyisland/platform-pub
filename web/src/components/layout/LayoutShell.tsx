// =============================================================================
// THE BLACK TOPBAR IS GONE (2026-07-25). `Nav` and `LandingNavRow` are deleted.
//
// What it was: a 60px black beam carrying a bare crimson ∀ + white wordmark and,
// for a logged-out visitor, Log in / Join the waiting list plus a mobile sheet.
// It was the last carrier of the retired marketing/auth register.
//
// Why it went rather than being restyled: it had already lost `/`, `/about` and
// `/admin` to a `chromelessRoute` allow-list, so the site shipped two houses at
// once — a visitor landing on `/` met the bone floor, the ⊔ walls and the
// lockup docked in a bottom row; a visitor following a shared article link met
// a black beam. An allow-list that grows every time a page is redesigned is a
// migration in progress, not a design. This finishes it: NOTHING mounts a
// topbar, and the sole chrome a logged-out visitor sees is PublicNavRow — the
// same row, in the same place, on every route.
//
// CONSEQUENCES TO KNOW ABOUT:
//   • `main`'s `pt-[60px]` offset is gone with the beam it cleared.
//   • ComposeOverlay used to be gated on `!chromeless`, which was doing double
//     duty: "there is a topbar" happened to coincide with "this is a logged-in
//     platform page, and no overlay is open". With the topbar gone that
//     predicate is always false, so the gate is now spelled out directly —
//     platform mode, no overlay open. Do not collapse it back into a chrome
//     flag; there is no chrome left to hang it on.
//   • The row's reserved band is published as `--ah-row-band` (NAV_ROW_H +
//     GRID when mounted, 0 otherwise) rather than applied as padding on
//     `main`. It cannot be padding, because the two kinds of public page need
//     the number in opposite ways: a FITTED page (PublicShell — the vessel is
//     wholly on screen and its contents scroll) SUBTRACTS it from its height,
//     while a SCROLLING page (the full-bleed share/SEO surfaces, which have no
//     vessel) ADDS it as bottom padding so its last line clears the row.
//     Padding on `main` would be right for the second and would push the first
//     into overflow. So each page reads the var and does its own arithmetic —
//     `.ah-public-fit` for the fitted case, `padding-bottom` for the other.
// =============================================================================

  // mode to canvas — but the underlying page is still the workspace.

  // The profile overlay pushes /<username> | /author/<id>, flipping the
  // URL-derived mode to canvas while the underlying surface is unchanged.
  const profileOpen = useProfile((s) => s.isOpen)

  // The row mounts for EVERYONE off the workspace — corrected in tranche 2.
  // The first cut gated it on `!authedUser`, on the reasoning that a member has
  // the workspace ∀. That was wrong: the retired topbar rendered a bare
  // wordmark beam for logged-in members precisely because standalone routes
  // (an invite link, a subscription offer, a shared article) sit outside the
  // workspace, and a member who lands on one would otherwise have no
  // navigation at all. PublicNavRow now varies its own left end by auth — the
  // two CTAs for a visitor, nothing but the lockup for a member — so the
  // mounting decision here is purely about the surface, not the viewer.
  //
  // It still waits for auth to RESOLVE. While `loading` is true we mount
  // nothing, so a member reloading a share link never flashes "Log in" at
  // themselves before WorkspacePaneRedirect bounces them into the workspace.
  // This replaces the `paneRedirectActive` suppression the retired shell needed.
  const authLoading = useAuth((s) => s.loading)

  // TWO FLAGS, NOT ONE, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS. Whether the row's BAND is
  // reserved is a question about the surface; whether the row RENDERS is also a
  // question about the viewer, because its left end differs by auth. Deriving
  // both from `!authLoading` would mean every public page laid itself out at
  // band 0, then reflowed by 64px the moment `fetchMe` came back — a visible
  // jump on every cold load, on the page a first-time visitor is most likely to
  // be looking at. So the band is reserved from the first paint on any surface
  // that WILL carry a row, and only the row itself waits for auth. The gap in
  // between is 64px of empty floor, which is invisible.
