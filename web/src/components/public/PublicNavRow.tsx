// =============================================================================
// PublicNavRow — the non-workspace nav row, and the only chrome outside the
// workspace.
//
// SUPERSEDES LandingNavRow AND Nav (the black topbar). The topbar was the last
// carrier of the retired marketing/auth register: black beam, white wordmark, a
// bare 21px crimson ∀ at the left, a mobile sheet of auth links. It survived on
// `/auth`, `/waitlist` and every share/SEO page while `/`, `/about` and
// `/admin` had already left it, so a visitor following a shared article link
// met one house and a visitor landing on `/` met another. One row now.
//
// MIRRORS NavRow + `ForallMenu anchor="row"`: same NAV_ROW_H, same
// `--ah-bone` ground, same lockup docked at the right end at disc 40 /
// wordmark 24.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// IT SERVES MEMBERS TOO (added in tranche 2, correcting tranche 1).
//
// The first cut mounted this for logged-out visitors only, on the reasoning
// that a member has the workspace ∀. That was wrong, and the retired topbar had
// already got it right: it rendered a BARE WORDMARK BEAM for a logged-in member
// on any standalone route, because those routes exist outside the workspace and
// a member who lands on one — an invite link in their email, a subscription
// offer, a shared article — would otherwise have no navigation at all. Deleting
// the topbar deleted that, and tranche 2's pages are exactly the ones a member
// reaches by following a link from outside the app.
//
// So the row mounts for everyone off the workspace, and the LEFT END is what
// changes:
//   • logged out — the two destinations the topbar carried (CLOSED-BETA-ADR
//     §IV: log in, and the waiting list; there is no public signup), and each
//     page shows the one it is NOT. Offering "Log in" on the login page was the
//     retired register's habit and read as a mistake.
//   • logged in — nothing. The member's destinations all live behind the ∀ in
//     the workspace, so duplicating any of them here would be dead chrome, and
//     showing "Log in" to a member would be simply wrong. The lockup alone is
//     the whole row, exactly as the bare beam was.
//
// AND THE LOCKUP POINTS SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT depending on who and where:
//   • member — `/reader`. A member's home IS the workspace; sending them to the
//     landing page, which HomeRedirect immediately bounces, is a round trip
//     through a page that exists to argue them into signing up for something
//     they already have.
//   • visitor ON `/` — `/waitlist`. `/` is already home, so a link there is a
//     dead no-op; on the landing page the lockup doubles as the get-started
//     target (`/auth?mode=signup` only redirects to the waiting list anyway).
//     Carried over from LandingNavRow, which this supersedes — the decision is
//     older than this component and shouldn't be lost with the file.
//   • visitor anywhere else — `/`.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NO DIVIDER, for the same reason NavRow has none: the lockup docked at its end
// is indicator enough, a full-width rule is a heavier statement than the row is
// making, and the sitewide no-single-pixel-lines invariant forbids a thin one
// in its place outright.
//
// NO LIGHT ISLAND. Unlike PublicVessel this sits on the plain `--ah-bone`
// floor and wants the neutral slugs as html.dark leaves them — it inverts with
// the global toggle, exactly as NavRow and the mobile bar do.
//
// The floor never reaches behind it: LayoutShell publishes `--ah-row-band`
// (NAV_ROW_H + GRID) whenever this row is mounted, which fitted pages subtract
// from their height and scrolling pages add as bottom padding.
