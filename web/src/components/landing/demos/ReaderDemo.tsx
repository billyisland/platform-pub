// =============================================================================
// ReaderDemo — the reading pane ON THE GLASSHOUSE. Supersedes GateDemo.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE BARE GATE. Shown on plain card ground it read as
// TEXT THAT HAD GONE WRONG — a paragraph trailing off into a fade, then a price,
// then two buttons, floating on nothing. Every part of the visual grammar that
// makes a paywall legible as a paywall was missing, because that grammar is not
// in the gate: it is in the SITUATION the gate appears in. A reader recognises a
// paywall by the shape of a pane held over an interrupted background, and there
// was no background and no pane.
//
// So the demo now shows the whole Glasshouse figure, which is the canonical
// "surface opened over the workspace" primitive:
//
//   FLOOR — four feed vessels in four colourways, blurred and desaturated. This
//           does double duty: it supplies the interrupted background the gate
//           needs, and it quietly restates the canvas argument from the demo
//           above, so a visitor sees the reader as something that opens OVER
//           their feeds rather than as a separate place they navigate to.
//   SCRIM — bone-bright at 0.72 (ink-925 at 0.74 in dark), matching `.gh-scrim`.
//   PANE  — glasshouse ground, lifted by an elevation shadow ALONE with no top
//           edge, per GLASSHOUSE-AND-PALETTE-ADR §III.2, carrying the drag grip
//           and the ✕. Inside it: the article, then the gate.
//
// THE BLUR IS A `filter` ON THE FLOOR, NOT `backdrop-filter` ON THE SCRIM. The
// real `.gh-scrim` uses backdrop-filter because it sits over a live, scrolling
// workspace it cannot know the contents of. Here the floor is inert markup that
// exists only to be blurred, so blurring it directly is cheaper, avoids the
// backdrop-filter containment bugs that bite inside transformed or clipped
// ancestors, and renders identically. Do NOT "correct" this to backdrop-filter
// for consistency with the real scrim — the situations are not the same.
//
// THE PANE'S MARGIN REPLACES THE OLD `INSET`. The previous version pulled the
// gate in from the card edge so it would read as a specimen rather than as the
// page's own prose. That signal is now carried structurally: a lifted pane over
// a blurred field cannot be mistaken for the page's content, so the inset is no
// longer doing separate work — it is just the pane's margin, which is what it
// looked like it was all along.
//
// SIZING, unchanged in principle: one base font-size on the root, everything
// inside in `em`, so the whole figure moves as a unit. It stays a clear step
// below the page's 17px prose, because the article text inside the pane is
// filler and a visitor who starts reading it gets nothing for it.
//
// THE BYLINES AND BODIES ON THE FLOOR ARE INVENTED — see the note in CanvasDemo,
// whose invented world this shares. It matters even here, where the floor is
// blurred to texture: blur is a rendering choice, and the names would still be
// in the markup, in the DOM, and in view of anyone who reads it. The floor cards
// are also DISTINCT from the other two demos' cards, per that same note; only
// the article in the pane is repeated, and deliberately.
//
// THE ARTICLE IS THE OMNIVORE DEMO'S PAID CARD. Ellis Marchetti's "The men who
// bought the lights" is priced in the feed above and gated here, and Third Rail
// is the publication the subscription line offers — so a visitor is asked to pay
// for a piece they have already read the opening of and been told the price of,
// rather than for an anonymous slab of filler. If either end of that pairing is
// rewritten, rewrite the other.
//
// AND THE PIECE HAS TO BE ONE A STRANGER WOULD PAY FORTY PENCE FOR. The whole
// figure is an argument about willingness to pay, so a gate closing over a
// gentle literary reminiscence demonstrates nothing except that the gate works.
// It closes over the story the rest of the page has spent three demos building
// — the Halcyon grid sale — at the paragraph where the writer says what they
// have and stops.
//
// WHY NOT REUSE PaywallGate. It takes fifteen props about a real reader's real
// balance, fires an IntersectionObserver, POSTs a nudge-shown event, and renders
// copy branched on login state and remaining credit. Mounting that on `/` to
// show a stranger what a paywall looks like would be absurd. This is the one
// branch of its copy that states the argument — used your credit, pay per read,
// subscription as the alternative — frozen as markup.

// THE PANE'S TEXT IS THE NEUTRAL TOKENS, NOT THE FEED PALETTE — and until
// 2026-07-29 it was the palette, which made the entire paywall figure unreadable
// in dark mode. The pane is a Glasshouse: `--ah-glasshouse`, and the landing
// vessel is a LIGHT ISLAND, so that slug resolves canonical WHITE in both modes.
// The `palette` prop, meanwhile, is `paletteFor('basic', dark)` — under the dark
// toggle its `cardTitle`/`cardStandfirst` are the LIGHT ends of the ramp, built
// for a dark card. Title, prose, "Keep reading", the price and the Subscribe
// button were all painting near-white on white; only the crimson button
// survived. Neutral slugs are the fixed-light-surface rule (CLAUDE.md, the
// Glasshouse exemption) and they are islanded here, so they resolve canonical in
// both modes. The FLOOR keeps the palette — those are feed cards, and they are
// meant to follow the toggle.
