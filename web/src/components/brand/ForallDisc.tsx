// =============================================================================
// ForallDisc — the disc-form ∀ on its own (no wordmark). The shared mark for
// surfaces that want just the glyph-on-a-disc: the landing lockup (via
// ForallLockup), the showcase placeholders, the closing coda.
//
// GEOMETRY IS THE DISC FORM'S, NOT THE BARE GLYPH'S
// (FORALL-CUT-AND-LOCKUP-ADR §III.1, as resolved 2026-07-22). Both ends pin to
// the rim — feet overshooting so the circle trims them flush through the top,
// apex mitring to a point that kisses the bottom — which forces the ≈16.7°
// splay. Do NOT substitute `ForAllMark` here: that is the bare glyph at the
// canonical ~20.5°, correct for Nav/Footer/About where there is no rim to kiss
// and wrong the moment you put a disc behind it.
//
// PAINT, NOT PUNCH (§II). The ∀ is drawn in the ground colour over an opaque
// disc rather than masked through it. On a flat known ground the two are
// pixel-identical, and every landing surface it sits on is flat.
//
// The disc inverts under `html.dark` exactly as ForallMenu's does (dark bone
// disc / ink glyph). It reads the mode via useResolvedDark (the DOM class the
// pre-paint script set), not the store's lagging `dark`, so a dark-mode visitor
// never paints the light disc first.
//
// The clip id is per-instance (`useId`): a page can hold several discs (lockup +
// coda + placeholders) and a shared literal id would collide.
