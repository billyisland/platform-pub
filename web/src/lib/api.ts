// =============================================================================
// API facade
//
// Split into api/<module>.ts during §52 refactor. This file is a transitional
// re-export so existing `from '@/lib/api'` imports keep working. Prefer
// importing from the specific module (`from '@/lib/api/auth'`, etc.) in new
// code; this facade can be removed once all call sites are migrated.
