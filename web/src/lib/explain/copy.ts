// Explain copy — EVERY caption the Explain engine renders, in one file.
//
// This file is prose only: no engine logic, no ordering, no DOM. Edit any
// string here at will; nothing else needs to change. The engine machinery
// (the ExplainKind union, sequence ordering, program builders) lives in
// ./registry.ts, which imports this file. The type annotations are the safety
// net: deleting or misnaming a caption fails the build instead of silently
// rendering nothing.
//
// Editorial voice (revised 2026-07): plain-spoken and conversational.
// Contractions and direct address are fine; a caption names what a thing is
// and what happens when you touch it, rather than teaching the model behind
// it. Repeated gestures still share grammar (A.4 notes inline). EXPLAIN-ADR
// Appendix A is the historical editorial record; this file is what the engine
// actually reads.
