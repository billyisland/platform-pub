// NEW 2026-07-25. There was no `not-found.tsx`, so every 404 — and there are
// several routes that call `notFound()` deliberately, e.g. /read/:postId for a
// native post id — fell through to the Next.js default: a centred sans-serif
// "404 | This page could not be found" on white, with a hairline divider. That
// was the single most off-brand screen on the site and the easiest to reach.
//
// A 404 on a link-shared platform is usually a DEAD SHARE — someone followed a
// link to a piece that has moved or been withdrawn — so the copy assumes that
// rather than assuming the visitor mistyped a URL.
