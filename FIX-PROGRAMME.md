# all.haus — consolidated fix programme

Merges `platform-pub-review.md` (DM path, resolver, feed-ingest, Stripe,
dead-code sweep) and `AUDIT-BACKLOG.md` (scheduler, access, subscriptions,
service structure, refactor debt) after spot-verification against `master`.

Both audits hold up on the things I re-checked against source. Where they
overlap (unused components, workspace setup, `generateDTag`/slug duplication)
they agree; where they don't overlap they are complementary — `AUDIT-BACKLOG`
§29 explicitly flagged DM / resolver / Stripe webhook as out of its scope, and
those are the core of `platform-pub-review`. Claims rejected by either audit
(`/my/account-statement` orphan, 32-md-file count, 42 `as any`) survive my
cross-check as rejected.

Priority is **correctness risk × blast radius × effort**. P0 items can silently
lose user money or corrupt state. P1 are real bugs but not actively destroying
data, or drift hazards. P2 is housekeeping. P3 is bigger architectural work.

Each item points at files/lines so the diagnosis can be re-checked before work
starts.

## Progress

- **2026-04-19** — Day 2 P0 Stripe orphans shipped: §3 (writer payout split
  into reserve→Stripe→complete with stable idempotency key `payout-${payoutId}`;
  new `resumePendingWriterPayouts` recovers crashed mid-flight payouts on the
  next cycle), §4 (publication payout same shape, N-multiplied — per-split
  `pub-split-${payoutId}-${accountId}` stable keys, per-split independent
  status updates so one Stripe failure no longer rolls back the others). §4
  subsumes §33 (dead "mark completed" block replaced by deterministic flip
  in finalisation) and, as a bonus, gives KYC-waiting splits a retry
  mechanism — previously they sat pending forever with no path forward. No
  migrations: schema already allowed `stripe_transfer_id NULL` and
  `'pending'` status for both tables. Still TODO for Day 2: §11 group-DM
  duplicate verify, §12 DM 402 decision, §5 NIP-17 naming decision.
- **2026-04-19** — Day 1 P0 shipped: §1 (scheduler vault ordering), §2 (Stripe
  webhook `processed_at` nullable dedup), §7 (`recordSubscriptionRead` wrapped
  in transaction), §8 (await the expiry-warning insert), §9 (new
  `expiry_warning_sent` event_type — migration 072), §10 (subscription charge
  reads `platformFeeBps` from config). Migrations 071–072 added.

## P0 — correctness bugs (fix first)

### 1. Scheduler: v2 encryption failure leaves paywalled article with no vault

**Verified:** `gateway/src/workers/scheduler.ts:127-232`. `publishPersonalDraft`
publishes v1 (free teaser) to the relay at :159, inserts the article at
:169-199 with `access_mode='paywalled'`, **then** tries v2 encrypt at :206.
Catch at :224 logs and continues. Draft is deleted on the outer success path.
Result: article is live on the relay (free content only), DB marks it
paywalled, no payload tag. Readers unlock and get nothing. Writer thinks it
shipped.

**Fix:** invert ordering — create vault first, build both events, publish v1
and v2 in sequence, insert DB row with final `event_id` once. Any failure
before DB insert leaves the draft on `article_drafts` for retry. Wrap in a
single logical unit; relay publish can't truly be rolled back but the DB
commit can anchor the "done" state.

### 2. Stripe webhook dedup race (event loss on crash)

**Verified:** `payment-service/src/routes/webhook.ts:56-78`. INSERT marks
event-seen *before* handler runs. If the process dies between INSERT and
`handleStripeEvent` return, the dedup row survives, Stripe retry hits the
duplicate branch and acks, event is lost. The `DELETE on catch` at :71 helps
only when the handler returns an error — a crash bypasses it.

**Fix:** add `processed_at TIMESTAMP NULL` column to `stripe_webhook_events`,
set it only on successful completion, dedup on `processed_at IS NOT NULL`.
Gives you a reconciliation log of attempted-but-failed events as a bonus.

### 3. Stripe transfer orphan — writer payouts

**Verified:** `payment-service/src/services/payout.ts:342-361`. Inside
`withTransaction`, `stripe.transfers.create` runs at :342 *before* the
`writer_payouts` INSERT at :355. If the INSERT (or either subsequent UPDATE)
throws, the transaction rolls back — but the Stripe transfer already
happened. Idempotency key is `payout-${writerId}-${randomUUID()}` per call
(:351), so retries don't dedupe against the orphan.

**Fix:** write payout row as `status='pending'` *before* calling Stripe, then
update to `'initiated'` after. Use a stable idempotency key
`payout-${payoutId}` so retries land on the same transfer.

### 4. Stripe transfer orphan — publication payouts (same shape, N-multiplied)

**Verified:** `payment-service/src/services/payout.ts:641-690`. Transfers
created in the loop at :661 *before* `publication_payout_splits` rows INSERT
at :683. Any later throw rolls the transaction back with real transfers
pending. Idempotency key includes `randomUUID()` (:671) so retries don't
dedupe.

**Fix:** insert all split rows as `status='pending'` first in one batch, then
iterate transfers updating to `'initiated'` or `'failed'`. Key on
`pub-split-${payoutId}-${accountId}` — no UUID.

### 5. NIP-17 publish is a fiction

**Verified:** `gateway/src/services/messages.ts:550-563`. `publishNip17Async`
signs a kind-14 event with `content: ''` and a `['conversation', convId]`
tag, publishes to the relay. No gift-wrap (1059), no seal (13), no
ciphertext, leaks conversation ID, reveals sender, decrypts to nothing. The
`event as any` cast on :558 is the tell. Real content lives in `direct_messages`
as NIP-44 envelopes; relay gets platform-internal metadata carrying a NIP-17
sticker.

**Fix:** choose one — rename to `publishConversationPulse` and own the
honest meaning, or stand up gift-wrap properly (kind-13 seal around the
kind-14, kind-1059 wrap around the seal, one wrap per recipient). Shipping
this as "NIP-17" is actively misleading.

### 6. `listInbox` mute filter drops whole conversations

**Verified:** `gateway/src/services/messages.ts:126-127`.
```sql
LEFT JOIN mutes m ON m.muter_id = $1 AND m.muted_id = cm.user_id
WHERE m.muter_id IS NULL
```
`cm` is pre-aggregation, so in a 3-person group where you've muted one
person, the entire conversation vanishes from your inbox — not just the
muted speaker. Also no block filter even though send/create both enforce it,
so a convo with someone who later blocked you stays in your inbox and 403s
on send.

**Fix:** move the mute check to filter members *inside* `array_agg` (or
aggregate into `member_ids` then filter down), and mirror the `blocks`
check the send path uses.

### 7. `recordSubscriptionRead` is two non-atomic inserts

**Verified:** `gateway/src/services/access.ts:100-121`. Two `pool.query`
calls, no transaction. If the second fails, the unlock sticks but the
`subscription_events` audit row is missing. Not catastrophic (the read did
happen) but the ledger drifts, and every other paired-write path in the
codebase uses `withTransaction`.

**Fix:** five-line wrap in `withTransaction`.

### 8. Expiry-warning dedup INSERT is fire-and-forget

**Verified:** `gateway/src/routes/subscriptions.ts:1099-1103`. `pool.query(…)`
without `await`, `.catch` attached. Function returns before the insert
lands. SIGTERM between email send and DB write → reader gets the warning
email twice next cycle.

**Fix:** add `await`. One character.

### 9. Expiry-warning marker abuses `event_type='subscription_charge'`

**Verified:** `gateway/src/routes/subscriptions.ts:1098-1103` inserts
`event_type='subscription_charge'`, `amount_pence=0`, description magic-
string `'Expiry warning sent'`. Dedup at :1086 matches on the description.
`SUM(amount_pence)` queries stay correct (amount is 0), but any
`COUNT(*) WHERE event_type='subscription_charge'` over-counts.

**Fix:** add `'expiry_warning_sent'` to the `event_type` enum, use it.
Migration + two lines.

### 10. Platform fee hardcoded in subscription-charge path

**Verified:** `gateway/src/routes/subscriptions.ts:1118` —
`Math.round(pricePence * 0.08)`. `gateway/src/routes/v1_6.ts:79-82` and
`gateway/src/routes/publications.ts:1259` both read
`platform_config.platform_fee_bps`. `shared/src/db/client.ts:91` exposes it
as `platformFeeBps` already loaded. Change the config row and subscription
earnings silently stay at 8%.

**Fix:** `Math.round(pricePence * platformFeeBps / 10000)` reading from the
config object the function already has. One line + regression test.

### 11. **Verify first** — group-DM sender-side duplicates

**Flagged by `platform-pub-review.md` §1.** `direct_messages` has one
`recipient_id` per row, so a group send inserts N rows. The
`loadConversationMessages` WHERE at `messages.ts:182` matches
`sender_id = $2` OR `recipient_id = $2`, so the sender sees their own
message N times (once per recipient row).

Determines whether the rework is "tidy the N+1" or "rethink data model".
Verify by sending a group DM and inspecting the returned list before
doing anything else — five minutes. Fix likely needs a message-envelope
row + per-recipient-ciphertext row rather than N envelope rows.

### 12. **Verify first** — is the DM 402 `dm_payment_required` ever consumed?

**Flagged by `platform-pub-review.md` §1.** `sendMessage`
(`messages.ts:296-308`) returns 402 with a price when any recipient
charges. Grep shows the string `dm_payment_required` only in the
definition and the throw — no endpoint takes payment and then unblocks
the send. Until one exists, this feature is "block with a price tag on
it", not a paywall.

Also all-or-nothing for groups (comment at :296 says "Full per-recipient
charging is a fast-follow"). Either ship the charge-and-unblock endpoint
or pull the 402 path until it's ready — the current state is worst of
both.

---

## P1 — real bugs and drift hazards

### Resolver (`gateway/src/lib/resolver.ts`)

**13. Bluesky handle regex eats dotted RSS hosts.** `BLUESKY_HANDLE`
(:135) matches any `word.word.word`, and the classifier at :149 tests it
before `AMBIGUOUS_AT` / `PLATFORM_USERNAME`. Paste `myblog.substack.com`
into the subscribe field and it classifies as a Bluesky handle and burns
an AppView round-trip before falling through. Almost certainly why
RSS-only inputs feel slow.
**Fix:** order URL > npub > did > fediverse > **ambiguous_at** >
**bluesky_handle** (existing checks), and require `.bsky.social` /
known bsky suffixes before the generic-dotted fallback, or gate
Bluesky-handle behind a successful AppView probe.

**14. Nostr inputs skip profile enrichment.** For npub/nprofile/hex_pubkey
Phase A emits an `external_source` match with only the hex pubkey
(:189-238). No Phase B kind-0 fetch. Paste an npub, see "unknown account".
Bluesky and Fediverse both enrich via `fetchActorProfile` /
`atprotoGetProfile`. This is the "half-wired branch" most clearly
present in this file.
**Fix:** add a `nostr_profile` entry to the Phase B pending chain;
resolver opens a temporary relay connection, REQs kind 0 for the pubkey,
updates the match.

**15. `pendingResolutions` has ambiguous completion signal.** `resolveAsync`
writes `pendingResolutions: []` on finish, but a mid-flight poll sees the
seed row with the original array. No way to tell "still running" from
"done, no matches".
**Fix:** add `status: 'pending' | 'complete'` or `completed_at` to
`resolver_async_results`. Poll returns the column.

**16. `ResolveContext` is dead.** Type has four values, passed into
`resolveAsync` at :301, read nowhere. `gateway` knip run flagged all six
public types from `resolver.ts` as unused externally, confirming it.
**Fix:** remove the parameter, or actually use it to bias which chain
runs first.

**17. `tryWellKnownPaths` serial loop is a silent amplifier.** 7 paths ×
default timeout = 7× slowdown on dead origins. No cache, two users pasting
the same URL hit origin 14×.
**Fix:** `Promise.any` over the first two, fall back to the rest only on
failure. Memoize ~5 min.

**18. `searchPlatform` uses leading-wildcard ILIKE.** Line 697
`pattern = '%' + escaped + '%'`. Btree index can't help. Full scan per
free-text query.
**Fix:** `pg_trgm` GIN index on `username` + `display_name`, or prefix-
only fast path.

### DM path (`gateway/src/services/messages.ts`)

**19. N+1 on send hot path.** Lines 297-308 pricing loop, then :317-332
serial encrypt + insert. 10-person group = 20+ DB round-trips + 10 serial
key-custody HTTP hops.
**Fix:** one `getDmPrice` query with `ANY()`, one batched encrypt call
(if key-service doesn't have a batch endpoint, add one — the encryption
itself is CPU-bound, not blocking), single multi-row INSERT.

**20. `rsa`/`rsa2` duplicate join.** `messages.ts:219-221` joins
`accounts` twice on `rdm.sender_id`, one alias for username
(`rsa.username`), another for pubkey (`rsa2.nostr_pubkey`). Same join.
**Fix:** collapse to `rsa`, select both columns.

**21. Silent skip on missing recipient pubkey.** `messages.ts:319-322`
logs and continues on missing pubkey; message not delivered but send
returns success. No way for caller to know.
**Fix:** return `{ messageIds, skippedRecipientIds }` in the response
payload, or fail hard if anyone's missing a pubkey (shouldn't happen in
practice but "shouldn't" is load-bearing here).

### Feed-ingest (`feed-ingest/src/**`)

**22. Kind 30023 ignores replaceable semantics.** `feed-ingest-nostr.ts`
stores each kind-30023 under an `nevent` URI (:384), not `naddr`. Author
updates a draft → second feed item appears. Feed shows stale versions.
**Fix:** for replaceable kinds (10000-19999, 30000-39999), key on
`naddr1(pubkey, kind, d-tag)`; upsert rather than insert.

**23. Kind-0 profile updates race metadata-refresh task.** Ingest path at
`feed-ingest-nostr.ts:243-268` updates `display_name`/`avatar_url` on
`external_sources`; separate `source-metadata-refresh` task does the
same. Two writers, no timestamp ordering. `COALESCE($3, display_name)`
at :264 handles null but not staleness.
**Fix:** make ingest compare-and-set — only write if the kind-0 event's
`created_at` is newer than a stored `metadata_updated_at` column. Or
drop the ingest-side update entirely and let metadata-refresh own it.

**24. Nostr `fetchFromRelay` doesn't CLOSE on timeout.** Lines 304-366,
timeout at :319 resolves without sending `CLOSE`. Only EOSE path does
(:347). Misbehaving relays that never EOSE keep the sub open 10s then
get the socket yanked. Some relays flag this as abuse.
**Fix:** send `['CLOSE', subId]` in the timeout branch before resolving.

**25. Nostr sub ID collisions.** `subId = 'feed-ingest-${Date.now()}'`
(:313). Millisecond collisions on busy relays.
**Fix:** UUID or monotonic counter.

**26. Nostr `verifyEvent` pins a core.** Schnorr verification runs
serially inside the relay-fetch loop — 5 relays × 50 events = 250 serial
verifies in the ingest hot path.
**Fix:** `Promise.all` across events per relay. Worker thread only if
throughput becomes an issue.

**27. AP outbox cursor anchors to skipped activities.** `activitypub.ts:162`
sets `newCursor = activityId` regardless of whether the activity passed
the Create/Note/isPublic filters. Skipped Announce at the top of the
outbox → cursor anchors to a non-ingestable item. If that item ever
changes/disappears (some Mastodon instances do), dedup breaks.
**Fix:** only advance cursor past activities that pass all filters.

**28. AP `cutoffMs` stop condition brittle.** Lines 175-179 stops paging
once `publishedAt < cutoffMs`. Mastodon outboxes can contain scheduled
(future) posts or per-page ordering off-by-one. Single stray older item
ends pagination early.
**Fix:** page by activity count (e.g. 200) or until you see N consecutive
items below cutoff, not the first.

**29. Jetstream DID cap at ~150-200 sources.** `listener.ts:249` appends
every DID as a `wantedDids` query param; WebSocket upgrade URL is bounded
by Jetstream server (~8-16 KB). ADR claims arbitrary scale; this is the
pinch point.
**Fix:** two options — DID-hash shard across N listener processes (each
owns half of the DID space), or once DID count exceeds ~150, subscribe
to wildcard firehose and filter client-side. Either is a half-day.

**30. Jetstream DID-set change replays everything.** Any change tears
down and reopens from `oldestCursor()` across all sources (:227-239).
ON CONFLICT saves the DB but bandwidth/CPU burn.
**Fix:** spin up a second scoped listener for just the new DID(s),
catch-up to live, then merge into the main filter at the next
reconnect boundary.

**31. Mastodon outbound truncation clips the quote URL.** `outbound-
cross-post.ts:125` appends source URL to `text`, then
`truncateWithLink(combined, { max })` truncates the end. Long quotes →
URL (the part that makes it a quote) is what gets cut.
**Fix:** budget is `maxChars − URL length − separator`, applied to
`text` *before* append.

### Payments (other)

**32. `computePublicationSplits` duplicate implementation.** 202 lines of
unit tests cover the pure function. `initiatePublicationPayout`
(`payout.ts:511`) **reimplements the same logic inline** at :535-629 —
flat fees, revenue_bps, standing shares, same order, same rounding. Bug
fixes have to land twice; the tests validate a function the DB path
doesn't use. The DB path also does `UPDATE publication_article_shares
SET paid_out = TRUE` inside the loop (:589) whereas the pure function
tracks IDs for the caller — it rolls back correctly by luck (transaction)
not design.
**Fix:** refactor `initiatePublicationPayout` to call the pure function,
then drive the DB writes off its result.

**33. Dead status-flag block at payout.ts:706-714.** Both disjuncts of
`allInitiated` check the same thing ("no splits with positive amounts").
The only time it's true is when the payout was empty, in which case
status was set to `'initiated'` at :635 and the UPDATE is a no-op. When
it's false (normal case), UPDATE sets status to `'initiated'` — already
what it was. Whole block does nothing. Intent was probably
`'completed'` when all transfers succeeded.
**Fix:** decide intent and implement it, or delete the block.

**34. `confirmPayout` is silent on missing row.** `payout.ts:407` straight
UPDATE, no `RETURNING`, no rowcount check. `transfer.paid` webhook for
an unknown `stripe_transfer_id` logs "confirmed" and returns success.
Stripe thinks it's fine; no payout record associates.
**Fix:** add `RETURNING id`, warn (and surface to reconciliation) when
rowcount is 0.

**35. `handleFailedPayout` status machine under-specified.** `failed_reason`
overwritten each call (no history). `completed_at` never cleared — a
completed payout that later receives `transfer.failed` (reversals can
cause this) ends up `status='failed'` *and* `completed_at != NULL`.
**Fix:** null `completed_at` when transitioning to failed; append to a
`failure_history jsonb` or log table rather than overwriting.

**36. Writer-eligibility rounding bias.** `payout.ts:261` per-row
`SUM(amount - FLOOR(amount * fee / 10000))` differs from
`total - FLOOR(total * fee / 10000)` by up to N pence (one per row).
1p read × 5% fee → floor(0.05) = 0, writer gets 1p, platform gets 0.
Probably intentional (platform absorbs dust) — verify against accrual
tests and document.

**37. Stripe API version is two years old.** `apiVersion: '2023-10-16'`
pinned in webhook.ts and payout.ts. Comment at payout.ts:90 already
acknowledges it (`'transfer.paid' not in SDK v14 types`). Bump when
touching these files anyway.

### Scheduler / cross-service plumbing

**38. `generateDTag` duplicated three times.** `scheduler.ts:265-274`,
`publication-publisher.ts:363-372`, `web/src/lib/publish.ts:202`. The
web test at `publish.test.ts:45` asserts identical output to gateway —
duplication is known. `scheduler.ts:131` uses the local copy while the
file *also* imports from `publication-publisher.js` (via
`publishToPublication`). Same file, two implementations.
**Fix:** move to `shared/src/lib/nostr.ts`, import from all three.

**39. Slug generation duplicated four times.** Identical pattern at
`articles.ts:66-71`, `scheduler.ts:163-167`, `scheduler.ts:267-271`
(inside `generateDTag`), `publication-publisher.ts:365-369`.
**Fix:** `slugify(title, maxLen)` in `shared/src/lib/slug.ts`. Subsumes
§38's slug step.

**40. Background workers exported from route files.**
`subscriptions.ts:937` exports `expireAndRenewSubscriptions`,
`drives.ts:822` exports `expireOverdueDrives`. `gateway/src/index.ts`
imports both and runs them under advisory locks. Inverted — `workers/`
already exists for this.
**Fix:** move both into `gateway/src/workers/`. Pair with P2 §48 (route-
file split) so the empty shells don't carry legacy worker exports.

**41. Advisory-lock IDs have a hole (100003).** `gateway/src/index.ts:245-247`
defines SUBSCRIPTIONS=100001, DRIVES=100002, SCHEDULER=100004. 100003
missing — classic "removed a worker" smell. Feed-ingest jetstream
listener at `listener.ts:115` also uses advisory locks in a separate
service.
**Fix:** `shared/src/lib/advisory-locks.ts` exporting a const object.
Document the gap in a comment.

**42. Env helper ignored by three services.** `shared/src/lib/env.ts`
exports `requireEnv` / `requireEnvMinLength`. Gateway uses it;
`key-service/src/index.ts:18-23`, `key-custody/src/index.ts:28-33`,
`payment-service/src/index.ts:15-17` each hand-rolled `for (const name
of ...)`.
**Fix:** five-minute find-and-replace.

**43. Traffology `(req as any).session?.sub` casts.**
`gateway/src/routes/traffology.ts:30,58,80,115,195` — five casts, all on
routes that already have `preHandler: requireAuth`. Other gateway routes
use `req.session!.sub!`.
**Fix:** replace the five casts. If the module augmentation in
`gateway/src/types/fastify.d.ts` isn't reaching this file, fix the
typing-import or the `tsconfig` include.

**44. `db/client.ts` shims in three services.** `key-service/src/db/client.ts`,
`key-custody/src/db/client.ts`, `payment-service/src/db/client.ts` are
pure re-exports from `shared/src/db/client.js`. Gateway imports shared
directly.
**Fix:** delete the shims, update imports.

**45. Mixed transaction idioms inside same file.**
`gateway/src/routes/publications.ts` has 9 raw `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`
tokens, 0 `withTransaction`. Other route files use `withTransaction`
exclusively. Split is by file, not by operation.
**Fix:** mechanical convert in `publications.ts` (and `tags.ts` if
similar). No behavioural change.

**46. Start script mismatch with Dockerfile.** Each service
`package.json` declares `"start": "node dist/src/index.js"`;
`gateway/Dockerfile:13` runs `tsx gateway/src/index.ts`. `start` never
invoked, build target vestigial. Production is re-transpiling on every
boot with no type check in the container.
**Fix:** make the Dockerfile build and run the built JS. Flagged P1
not P0 because it works today — but "works" hides a real correctness
concern (no type check in prod build).

---

## P2 — housekeeping, dead code, refactor

### Dead code (delete now)

**47. Unused components.** Six confirmed orphans with zero imports:
- `web/src/components/feed/NoteComposer.tsx` (188 lines, replaced by
  `ComposeOverlay`)
- `web/src/components/ui/NotificationBell.tsx` (274)
- `web/src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (43)
- `web/src/components/ui/UserSearch.tsx` (105)
- `web/src/components/dashboard/DrivesTab.tsx` (93)
- `web/src/components/icons/ThereforeMark.tsx` (43)

`platform-pub-review` §5 also flagged `OffersTab.tsx` and
`FeaturedWriters.tsx` — double-check with a fresh grep before deletion.
`globals.css:551` has a stale `[class*="NoteComposer"]` selector; remove
in the same change. Also the six test files whose subjects are
themselves orphans.

**48. Knip findings in web.** `lib/api.ts`: `keys`, `follows`, `search`,
`writers` API groupings + a dozen orphan response types (`SignupResult`,
`GatePassResponse`, `ResolvedContent`, `Publication`, etc.) unused.
`lib/ndk.ts`: `KIND_VAULT`, `KIND_RECEIPT`, `KIND_DRAFT`, `KIND_CONTACTS`,
`KIND_REACTION` unused. `lib/vault.ts`: three decrypt helpers unused.
Editor nodes (`EmbedNode`, `ImageUpload`, `PaywallGateNode`): named +
default export of same thing.
**Fix:** delete the unused API groupings (one-liners). For vault helpers,
confirm they're not server-imported before deleting. For kind constants,
delete — planned surface that didn't land.

**49. Knip findings in gateway.** `src/lib/errors.ts` (15-line `sendError`
helper) imported by nothing; routes keep `reply.status().send()`. Either
adopt or delete.

All six public types from `resolver.ts` (`InputType`, `MatchType`,
`Confidence`, `ResolveContext`, `ResolverMatch`, `ResolverResult`) unused
externally → route handler returns raw output without typing it.

All six from `messages.ts` (`InboxConversation`, `ConversationMessage`,
`SendMessageResult`, `DecryptRequest`, `DecryptResult`, `DmPricingSummary`)
unused externally → same pattern.
**Fix:** either type the route responses against these (cheap, recovers
the service-to-route contract) or remove `export`. Pick one per file,
not one per type.

**50. Unused + unlisted deps.** `date-fns`, `clsx` in `package.json`,
never imported — free weight to cut. `@tiptap/core` and
`prosemirror-state` imported but not listed — resolve through transitive
`@tiptap/react`, will break if tiptap upgrades unbundled.

**51. `provenance-ikb.jsx` at repo root.** 547 lines, only `.jsx` file
in the repo, no imports.
**Fix:** `git rm`.

### Refactor / naming

**52. Split `web/src/lib/api.ts`.** 1,685 lines, 87 exports, already
grouped in-file by domain. Split into `api/{auth,articles,feed,…}.ts`;
keep `api.ts` as `export *` for one release; delete.

**53. Split three gateway mega-route-files.** `publications.ts` 1,353
lines / 29 routes, `articles.ts` 1,153, `subscriptions.ts` 1,138. Split
each into a directory. Pair with §40 so the worker extraction happens
at the same time.

**54. Rename ambiguous files.** `routes/feed.ts` → `timeline.ts`,
`routes/feeds.ts` → `external-feeds.ts`, `routes/v1_6.ts` →
`my-account.ts` (or split into `reading-tab.ts` + `account-statement.ts`).
Both v1_6 handlers are live — `AccountLedger.tsx:51` consumes
`/my/account-statement` — so this is a rename, not a deletion.

**55. Move audit/planning markdowns out of root.** 22 `.md` files at
root (audit claimed 32 — overstated).
**Fix:** `docs/adr/` for specs (ALLHAUS-REDESIGN-SPEC, UNIVERSAL-FEED-ADR,
ALLHAUS-OMNIBUS, etc.), `docs/audits/` for `platform-pub-review.md`,
`AUDIT-BACKLOG.md`, this file. Keep `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`DEPLOYMENT.md`, `feature-debt.md` at root.

**56. Stale docker-compose.yml header.** Comment at :1-17 lists 9
services; actual file also has key-custody, feed-ingest, traffology-
ingest, traffology-worker. 30-second fix.

**57. Cursor parser accepts non-UUID ids.** `routes/feed.ts:39-59` —
`id.length >= 36` check but no UUID format. No injection risk
(parameterised). Cosmetic.

## P3 — bigger moves (do when the return justifies it)

**58. Root `knip.json` + CI hook failing on new unused exports.** The
single biggest quality lever available. Refactor corpses — `lib/format.ts`
says `// Consolidated from ArticleCard, NoteCard, FeaturedWriters` and
those files are still there — would have become build errors at the
moment of creation. Pair with workspace setup (§59) so knip sees the
full graph.

**59. Adopt npm (or pnpm) workspaces.** Root `package.json` has no
`workspaces`. Dockerfiles do a symlink dance
(`RUN ln -sf /app/shared /app/gateway/shared`) to make
`../../shared/src/…` imports work. Per-service tsconfigs override
`rootDir` to `.` specifically so symlinked `shared/` compiles into each
service's `dist/`. The shims in §44 exist because of the same pressure.
**Fix:** one day, removes a whole category of papercuts.

**60. Outbox pattern for relay publishing.** Every `INSERT … ;
publishToRelay(signed)` with ad-hoc retry — the scheduler v1/v2 hazard
(§1), `recordSubscriptionRead` (§7), publication-publisher, notes
deletion — becomes "write intended-publish record in transaction,
worker picks it up". feed-ingest already runs Graphile Worker; extend it
to a gateway outbox. Week of work, biggest correctness dividend on
this list. Do the tactical fixes §1-10 first — they ship individually;
the outbox replaces them but shouldn't gate them.

**61. Gate-pass orchestration module.**
`routes/articles.ts`'s `/articles/:nostrEventId/gate-pass` handler,
`services/access.ts`, and payment-service each own a piece. Gateway
also computes `readerPubkeyHash` inline and manages tab creation — three
roles in one handler. Pull gateway-side orchestration into
`services/article-access/`. Half-day.

**62. Consider merging key-service + key-custody.** 918 + 447 lines, 15
files. Security split is real (different key material in each) but may
not justify two containers. Defer.

**63. Round-3 audit targets.** Not covered by either prior round:
Traffology ingest flow (`traffology-ingest`, `traffology-worker`), most
feed-ingest adapters (33 files, 4.7k lines), ATProto OAuth client setup
(`shared/src/lib/atproto-oauth.ts`), full sweep of `feed_items` insert
sites (publication-publisher, note ingest, external-feed dual-writes)
for `content_preview` / truncation consistency, full `ts-prune`
alongside `knip` across all services.

## Rejected / overstated claims (held over from both audits)

- **`/my/account-statement` has no web consumer** — *wrong*. Consumed by
  `web/src/components/account/AccountLedger.tsx:51`. The rename (§54) is
  still worth doing; the endpoint is live.
- **32 markdown files in repo root** — actual is 22. Still cluttered
  (§55), but the bigger number in the audit was wrong.
- **42 `as any` in gateway** — actual is 38 across 14 files. Substantive
  claim — 5 of them are in `traffology.ts` as auth shortcuts (§43) —
  holds.
- **`content_preview .slice(0, 200)` in one place, who-knows-what
  elsewhere** — flagged in the first audit as TODO-verify, never
  confirmed. Folded into §63.

## Attack order (one focused week)

**Day 1 — P0**
§7 `recordSubscriptionRead` wrap, §8 `await` the warning insert, §9
event_type migration, §10 platform fee read from config, §1 scheduler
ordering inversion, §2 webhook dedup `processed_at` column. Each
small, each as its own commit with a regression test.

**Day 2 — P0 Stripe orphans + verify-firsts**
§3 writer-payout row-first + stable key, §4 publication-split same.
§11 group-DM duplicate verify (5 minutes) → fix if confirmed.
§12 DM 402 decision (ship unblock endpoint or pull the 402 path).
§5 NIP-17 naming decision (rename vs implement).

**Day 3 — P1 mechanical**
§38-39 shared slugify/dTag, §40 move workers, §41 advisory locks const,
§42 env helper adoption, §43 traffology casts, §44 db/client shims,
§56 docker-compose header, §20 `rsa`/`rsa2` collapse, §6 `listInbox`
mute filter fix.

**Day 4 — P1 structural**
§13-18 resolver fixes (ordering, Nostr enrichment, completion signal,
dead param, well-known paths, search index), §45 transaction idiom
convergence, §46 build-for-prod Dockerfile, §19 DM send N+1 collapse.

**Day 5 — P1 feed-ingest + payments cleanup**
§22 kind-30023 naddr, §23 kind-0 race, §24-26 Nostr hygiene,
§27-28 AP cursor/cutoff, §31 Mastodon truncate, §29-30 Jetstream
DID-cap, §32-35 payment-service tightening.

**Day 6-7 — P2 deletions + refactors**
§47-51 dead code. §52 split api.ts. §54 rename files. §55 move
markdowns.

**Later**
§53 mega-route-file split (no behavioural change, but the diff is
large). §58 knip + CI. §59 workspaces. §60 outbox. §63 round-3 audit.
