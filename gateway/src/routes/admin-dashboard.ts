  // GET /admin/dashboard/waitlist — the closed-beta waiting list, read-only
  //
  // CLOSED-BETA-ADR §XI.2. The list has been write-only since migration 162:
  // POST /waitlist stores a prospect and nothing reads the table, so the only
  // way to see who was waiting was psql on the box — which is how a real
  // prospect went unnoticed for eight hours on 2026-07-27. The digest (§XI.4)
  // now says the count moved; this says WHO, which is the half an operator
  // needs to pick a cohort.
  //
  // NO `publish_interest` ANYWHERE HERE (2026-07-27). The "I'd also like to
  // publish" tickbox was removed from the page, and its tile and column went
  // with it rather than being left to report on a question nobody is being
  // asked. The COLUMN survives — those were answers people gave, and ceasing to
  // ask is not the same as deleting what was said — but nothing reads it.
  //
  // The admission state (migration 163) rides along: `admittedAt` says an
  // account exists for this address, `invitedAt` says the invitation email
  // actually went, and they are separate because the send happens outside
  // the admission transaction and can fail on its own. A row that is admitted
  // but not invited is the state the panel offers a retry on — an admission
  // nobody heard about is the exact failure this section exists to stop.
  //
  // NO FILTERING, BY DESIGN. The list attracts disposable addresses — one of
  // the first three real rows was from a temp-mail domain. The domain is right
  // there in the address for an operator to read; auto-rejecting a domain list
  // is a policy decision with false positives, and it belongs to a person
  // looking at a screen, not to a heuristic in a route. Sort and see.
  //
  // The cap is 500 with an explicit `truncated` flag rather than pagination:
  // the beta is 20–30 people, but a silent LIMIT would read as "that's
  // everyone" precisely when it isn't.

  // panel, and the §3.7 minimum for running a closed beta at all: until now,
  // converting a waitlister into a member meant hand-writing SQL on the box.
  //
  // It does three things, in this order, and the order is the design:
  //
  //   1. CLAIM the row (`admitted_at IS NULL` → now()). One statement, so two
  //      concurrent admits — the operator double-clicking a slow button — race
  //      on the database and exactly one wins. The loser reads the row it
  //      didn't claim and reports it already admitted.
  //   2. Find-or-create the account. `provisionAccount` deliberately BYPASSES
  //      the CLOSED_BETA gate: that constant exists to reserve account creation
  //      to a human decision, and this IS that decision, taken by an admin
  //      behind requireAdmin. A prospect who is already a member (the operator
  //      testing the form with their own address is the likely first case, and
  //      one of the three live prod rows is exactly that) is LINKED, not
  //      duplicated — accounts.email is unique, so a blind insert would 500.
  //   3. Send the invitation, and stamp `invited_at` only if it went.
  //
  // THE EMAIL IS OUTSIDE THE CLAIM, AND ITS FAILURE DOES NOT UNDO ANYTHING
  // (D7's rule, applied to admission). The account is the product; the message
  // is the courtesy. A Postmark blip must not roll back a real account or
  // release the claim, because the retry would then try to create it again.
  // Instead the row rests at "admitted, not yet told", the panel shows that
  // state and offers a resend, and this route's own resend path is the same
  // endpoint called again.
  //
  // RESERVE→CREATE→CONFIRM, so a failure between the claim and the account is
  // not a stuck row: if provisioning throws, the claim is RELEASED (guarded on
  // `admitted_account_id IS NULL`, so it can never clobber a concurrent
  // success) and the operator can simply click again.

  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // POST /admin/dashboard/seed-formula — designate the default seed
  //
  // Two bodies, one act: `{ formulaId }` designates a formula that already
  // exists, `{ feedId }` cuts one of the admin's own feeds into a NEW formula
  // and designates that in the same transaction.
  //
  // Three things about this endpoint are load-bearing:
  //
  //  1. It is NOT gated on FEED_FORMULAS_ENABLED. That brake gates publish and
  //     redeem-by-token; the seed path must not share it (ADR §6), or an
  //     operator who turns the flag off can no longer mint the thing every new
  //     account depends on. The `{ feedId }` branch exists for exactly that
  //     reason — the composer's publish action IS behind the brake.
  //  2. There is no way to CLEAR the designation, deliberately (D11).
  //     Undesignating happens only by designating a replacement, so this route
  //     swaps both rows in one transaction and never merely clears one. The
  //     schema refuses to delete or revoke a designated row; a route that could
  //     empty the slot would be the same outage through a door the schema
  //     cannot close.
  //  3. A formula with no sources is refused. A sourceless seed feed
  //     auto-serves the explore placeholder, so every new member would open
  //     what they believe the platform composed for them and be shown the
  //     platform stream (the §12 departure, one level up).
