// Helper — log subscription charge and earning events (audit F1, 2026-07-05)
//
// The hourly renewal/expiry worker lives in workers/subscription-expiry.ts
// and imports logSubscriptionCharge from this file (via the directory index).
//
// BEFORE F1 this only wrote two subscription_events rows and the CALLER
// decremented accounts.free_allowance_remaining_pence. That column is NOT the
// reading tab: no code path ever converted a negative allowance into a
// settleable balance, so subscription revenue was never collected and the
// writer's credit never entered a payout (audit finding 1, a P0). F1 makes the
// charge collectable by the SAME settlement machinery reads use:
//
//   • Reader leg — debit reading_tabs.balance_pence by the full price (a debt,
//     exactly like a read accrual) and post the mirror subscription_charge
//     ledger entry (−price), so −SUM(reader entries) == reading_tabs.balance_pence
//     holds and settlement.ts collects it. The free_allowance decrement is
//     removed from all call sites.
//   • Writer leg — post subscription_earning (+net) for WRITER subscriptions and
//     fold it into the per-read payout base (payout.ts claims it once via
//     subscription_events.writer_payout_id). Publication subscriptions collect
//     (reader leg) but post no earning ledger entry here — publication income
//     flows through the publication pool, a follow-on.
//
// Rounding (audit F11): the platform fee now FLOORs (Math.floor), matching the
// per-row-then-floor rule the rest of the money paths follow — not the prior
// Math.round, a second definition of "net".
// =============================================================================

// A subscription targets a writer (writerId) XOR a publication (publicationId);
// the event's writer_id / publication_id mirrors that. subscription_events
// requires at least one target (migration 103).
