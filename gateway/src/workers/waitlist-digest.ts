// =============================================================================
// Waitlist operator digest — CLOSED-BETA-ADR §XI, D8.2. Runs hourly from
// gateway/index.ts under ADVISORY_LOCKS.WAITLIST_DIGEST; sends at most one
// message a day, and only when the list has actually moved.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `POST /waitlist` stores a prospect and sends nothing (D2 —
// capture, not a mailto), and until the panel is built (§XI.2) nothing reads
// the table. On 2026-07-27 that combination meant a real prospect sat unseen
// for eight hours and was found only because the operator went looking for a
// missing confirmation email. This closes that: the count moves, you hear
// about it. It is the smallest possible fix for the actual failure, which is
// why §XI.3 puts it first — ahead of the joiner's acknowledgement, which is
// more visible and less urgent.
//
// TWO KEYS, BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO FACTS. `waitlist_digest_watermark` is
// "everything created at or before this instant has been reported" and holds a
// ROW's `created_at`; `waitlist_digest_last_sent_at` is when a digest actually
// went out and holds a CLOCK reading. The window is asked of the first, the
// cadence of the second, and they are never swapped. One key doing both was
// the first cut of this worker, and it drifted: on a quiet list the watermark
// is soon older than the interval, so every tick reads as due — harmless while
// nothing is new, wrong the moment something is (a digest at 10:00 whose
// newest row was from 02:00 would fire again at 02:00 the next day, not 10:00).
// The unit tests all passed; a run against a real database is what showed it.
//
// The watermark advances to the newest REPORTED row's `created_at` — not to
// `now()`, which would silently swallow anything that arrived between the
// SELECT and the write. Two consequences worth keeping:
//
//   · Nothing to report → NEITHER key moves. The window stays open and keeps
//     widening, so a join can never fall between two digests.
//   · The send failed → neither key moves either, so the next run retries the
//     same rows rather than dropping a day's joins on one bad minute at
//     Postmark. That is D7's rule applied here: mail is the courtesy, the row
//     is the product.
//
// Both are runtime STATE, so both are deliberately absent from
// config-defaults.sql (the same posture as `payouts_halted`) — absence means
// "never sent", which is the correct cold-start reading. The cadence beside them
// (`waitlist_digest_interval_hours`) IS a dial and IS in the defaults file.
// Both are written by upsert, never a bare UPDATE, which against an absent key
// matches zero rows and reports success — the way `jetstream_healthy` once
// silently never persisted.
//
// ON PII. The digest lists prospects' addresses, which puts them through
// Postmark for a purpose `WAITLIST-PRIVACY-NOTE.md` does not yet name. The
// alternative — a bare count, with the addresses only in the panel — was
// declined because the count alone would not have told the operator that a
// journalist was waiting, and finding that out was the whole point. The
// recipients are the admin accounts, i.e. the controller, so this is transit
// rather than disclosure; it belongs in the note's next pass all the same
// (D9). If counsel says otherwise, cut the list and keep the counts: the
// digest still does its job.
