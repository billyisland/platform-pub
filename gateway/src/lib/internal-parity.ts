// internal-parity — the gateway proves, at boot, that it holds the same shared
// secrets as the services it calls.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO END (found on prod 2026-08-07). `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`
// differed between `gateway/.env` and `payment-service/.env`. The payment
// service answered 403 to everything the gateway proxied — including
// `/gate-pass`, which is the paywall — so EVERY paywalled unlock failed while
// the site looked entirely healthy. Nothing detected it. It surfaced only
// because a new admin panel happened to proxy on a page load rather than behind
// a button, and even then it took three rounds to identify, because the gateway
// passed the upstream status to the browser without logging it.
//
// A drifted shared secret is the worst shape a config error can take: it is
// silent, it is total for the paths it touches, and it looks like nothing. The
// fix is one line in one file — the cost is entirely in NOT KNOWING.
//
// TWO SECRETS, THREE PEERS. `INTERNAL_SECRET` (gateway → key-custody,
// key-service) has the wider surface of the two and breaks publishing, key
// issuance and paywalled delivery; `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` (gateway → payment)
// breaks the money paths. Both are checked, because building this for only the
// one that happened to bite would leave the larger hole open.
//
// HOW THE PROOF WORKS. Each peer exposes `GET /api/v1/auth-check` behind ITS OWN
// existing internal guard. Reaching the handler proves the caller's secret
// matches the verifier's, so a 200 IS the parity proof — no hash, fingerprint or
// length is exchanged, because the guard already answers the question and an
// echoed digest would be a disclosure surface bought for nothing.
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT BLOCK `listen()`. The gateway serves all free reading, auth
// and feeds; coupling its availability to a money or key service being up at
// startup would be a worse bug than the one being fixed. So the probe runs
// AFTER the gateway is listening and its own healthcheck can pass, and only a
// DEFINITIVE mismatch is ever acted on.
// =============================================================================

 * `requireInternalToken` sends **403**, while `key-service`'s plugin-scope
 * preHandler and `key-custody`'s `requireInternalSecret` both send **401**. A
 * classifier written for 403 alone — the status of the incident that prompted
 * this — would silently never detect an `INTERNAL_SECRET` drift at all, which is
 * the wider of the two surfaces. It would also pass every test anyone thought to
 * write, because the one failure they had in mind was the payment one.
 *
 * **404 is NOT a mismatch.** A peer running an older image has no `/auth-check`,
 * and treating that as a definitive failure would crash-loop the gateway during
 * any partial deploy — turning a routine version skew into an outage. Reported
 * distinctly because "old peer" and "peer is down" want different responses.
 *
 * **503 is ambiguous, not terminal.** It is what `key-custody` returns when its
 * OWN secret is unset. That would be a fatal config error, but it is the peer's
 * to report — and in practice unreachable, since all three peers `requireEnv`
 * their secret and refuse to boot without it.
