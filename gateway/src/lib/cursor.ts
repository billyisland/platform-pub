// Keyset-cursor primitives — the ONE home for the M13 rule.
//
// Every time-based keyset cursor in the gateway compares its epoch via
// `to_timestamp()` against a full-precision `published_at`/`created_at` that the
// ORDER BY also sorts at full precision. So the epoch must survive the
// encode→wire→decode round trip WITHOUT losing its fraction. Truncated to the
// whole second, the cursor lands EARLIER than the row it was minted from, and
// the tuple filter then excludes every remaining row inside that second — the
// client never reaches them.
//
// This module exists because that rule had been written out THREE times
// (`parseCursorEpoch` in feed-sql.ts, plus two inline copies in
// routes/feeds/items.ts) and the encoder had been hand-rolled in FIVE places.
// M13 is the bug class that already recurred once: the original fix corrected
// the SQL and the encoders but left the decoders on `parseInt`, so the fix was
// inert and shipped green. A rule duplicated N times is a rule that gets fixed
// N-1 times.
//
// Scope note — this unifies the CODEC, deliberately not the WIRE FORMATS. There
// are two live shapes: the untagged `ts:id` / `score:ts:id` family decoded by
// `parseCursor` (feed-sql.ts) and the tagged `scored:…` / `explore:…` family
// decoded by `decodeFeedCursor` (routes/feeds/items.ts). Collapsing them would
// invalidate every cursor a client currently holds mid-pagination, for no
// correctness gain. What matters is that both families parse their epoch
// through the same function, and that nobody hand-rolls the encoder again.

/**
 * Parse a cursor's epoch component — `Number`, never `parseInt`.
 *
 * The epoch on the wire is FRACTIONAL (`EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM …)` with no
 * `::bigint` cast, e.g. `1784282400.500123`). `parseInt` stops at the `.` and
 * silently truncates to the whole second, reinstating the exact page-boundary
 * bug the fractional cursor exists to prevent.
 *
 * Stricter than `parseInt` by design: a malformed component yields NaN (→ the
 * caller restarts from page 1, the documented degradation) rather than being
 * salvaged into a wrong position. Empty string is rejected explicitly, because
 * `Number("")` is 0 — which would silently mean "the epoch", i.e. 1970.
