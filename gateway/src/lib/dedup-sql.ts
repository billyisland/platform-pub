// =============================================================================
// Slice 8 P1 — cross-source dedup SQL fragments.
//
// Factored out of feeds/items.ts so the integration test (gateway/tests/
// dedup-integration.test.ts) exercises the *exact same* SQL the live feed query
// runs — there is no second copy to drift. The host query is responsible for the
// `matched` CTE (the feed's pre-LIMIT candidate item set) and a `scored` CTE; the
// fragments below slot in between and after.
//
// Param contract: `$1` is the reader id (already threaded through
// sourceFilteredItems). Owner-aware: a link applies when it is global
// (`owner_id IS NULL`, P3 automated detection) or asserted by this reader
// (`owner_id = $1`, P2 "Link to…"), minus any pair this reader has tombstoned
// (P3 `user_unlinked` negative override — see below).
//
// HOST REQUIREMENT: because `DEDUP_CTES` contains a recursive CTE (the link-graph
// transitive closure, `link_closure`), the host's top-level `WITH` MUST be
// `WITH RECURSIVE` (Postgres puts the keyword once on the outer WITH; the
// non-recursive CTEs in the list are unaffected). Both call sites — feeds/items.ts
// and the integration test — open with `WITH RECURSIVE`.
// =============================================================================

// The dedup CTEs. Slot between `matched` and `scored`:
//   WITH RECURSIVE feed_mode AS (…), matched AS (…), ${DEDUP_CTES}, scored AS (…)
//
// Two cross-posted copies (e.g. an article on RSS + its Bluesky share) carry
// different effective_score, so they are not page-adjacent — in-page dedup leaks
// the twin. Instead we pick a page-independent winner per fingerprint and
// suppress losers across the whole candidate set (`matched`, pre-LIMIT).
//
// `applicable_links` materialises the links that apply to THIS reader once, and
// everything downstream references it: global (owner NULL) ∪ this reader's own
// assertions, EXCLUDING the `user_unlinked` negative override itself and any
// (ordered) pair the reader has tombstoned with one (P3 — a reader can't delete a
// global fact for everyone, so unlinking a detected link writes an owner-scoped
// tombstone the read path subtracts).
//
// TRANSITIVE connectivity (not pairwise): the same content cross-posted to three+
// sources may be linked as a CHAIN (s1–s2, s2–s3, no s1–s3) or a STAR (a native
// bridged to two mirrors that aren't linked to each other). A pairwise winner rule
// leaks here — if the connecting source is the loser it gets suppressed by both
// ends, leaving two same-fingerprint copies that aren't *directly* linked both
// surviving. So we compute the link graph's connected components once
// (`link_closure` → `source_component`) and dedup within a (component, fingerprint)
// group: one component → one survivor, however the edges are shaped.
//
// Perf guard: only sources in an applicable link get a component, so `candidates`
// inner-joins `source_component` and never sees an unlinked source. Most feeds have
// zero links → the closure and candidates are empty → near-zero cost. Components
// are tiny (a handful of cross-posted sources), so the transitive closure is cheap.
