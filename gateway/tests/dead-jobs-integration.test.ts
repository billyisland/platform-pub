// Dead background jobs — what the surface counts, and what it must not
// (CONSOLIDATED-TODO §8.15).
//
// The heartbeat alarm answers *is the worker running*. It cannot answer *is the
// worker failing everything it picks up*: a job that exhausts its attempts stops
// being retried and sits in graphile_worker's table forever, mentioning itself
// to nobody. `relay_outbox_prune` was red for 84 consecutive nights on prod
// that way, and the fault underneath it had silently deactivated four members'
// feeds.
//
// WHY THIS RUNS AGAINST REAL POSTGRES. Every claim the query makes is one only
// a database can settle — a `json ->` probe for the cron marker, four aggregate
// FILTERs, `make_interval` recency, and a three-way split of one attempts/
// locked_at/last_error state space. A mocked `pool.query` would hand back
// whatever this file already believed, which is the same epistemic mistake
// §8.16 was. The route-level shaping (arms, sums, the unreadable third state)
// is pinned separately in admin-ingest-liveness.test.ts against the mock.
//
// The SQL is IMPORTED, never retyped: a copy would pin the copy, and the copy
// is the one thing that cannot drift out of step with itself.
//
// Fixtures live inside a transaction that is ALWAYS rolled back, so the target
// DB's real job queue is never touched. Skipped without a DB URL so the
// no-Postgres CI job stays green. Run locally:
//   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://platformpub:password@localhost:5432/platformpub \
//     npx vitest run tests/dead-jobs-integration.test.ts
