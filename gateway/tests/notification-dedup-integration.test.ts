// idx_notifications_dedup — what it collapses, and what it must not.
//
// Three migrations are pinned here. 172 widened the index with offer_id; 173
// made it PARTIAL (`WHERE read = false`), which is migration 019's intent
// finally reaching a database — 019 was seeded as applied by schema.sql and so
// never ran anywhere, leaving "repeat events silently fail to notify" live for
// three years; 174 added drive_id and the two missing ON CONFLICT clauses. All
// three live in one file because they are one index, and because the
// interesting risk is the same each time: that fixing it quietly stops it
// deduping at all.
//
// Every `INSERT INTO notifications` in the codebase is a bare
// `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` — 22 sites, none naming an inference target — so
// which notifications collapse into one is decided ENTIRELY by that unique
// index. Before 172 it keyed on (recipient, actor, type, article, note,
// comment) with the NULL references COALESCEd to a sentinel, and a grant
// notification sets none of those three: so a writer's SECOND gift to the same
// reader was silently dropped, and `DO NOTHING` did not even reopen the first
// (already-read) row. The one person the offer exists for was never told.
//
// Only Postgres can evaluate this — the index is a unique constraint over
// COALESCE expressions, and a mocked pool.query would be pinning the mock's
// idea of collision rather than the database's. The route-level test
// (subscription-offers-grant.test.ts) pins that offer_id is BOUND; this pins
// what binding it BUYS.
//
// Fixtures live inside a transaction that is ALWAYS rolled back, so the target
// DB is never mutated. Skipped without a DB URL so the no-Postgres CI job stays
// green. Run locally:
//   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://platformpub:password@localhost:5432/platformpub \
