-- =============================================================================
-- config-defaults.sql — the canonical default value of every platform_config
-- tuning dial. Applied by shared/src/db/migrate.ts on EVERY run, after the
-- migration chain, always with ON CONFLICT (key) DO NOTHING.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--
-- Dials used to be seeded by the migration that introduced them. That silently
-- did not work on a fresh database. schema.sql is the genesis base and is
-- STRUCTURE ONLY (pg_dump, no data) — but it also seeds `_migrations` with every
-- migration filename, so migrate.ts skips those migrations as already-applied
-- and their INSERTs never run. Any dial seeded by a migration older than the
-- current genesis dump was therefore simply absent on every DB booted from
-- schema.sql. Measured on dev 2026-07-20: 31 of 45 dials missing.
--
-- Mostly that was masked, because each consumer carries a code fallback equal to
-- the seeded value — but "masked" is not "harmless": it demotes an operator dial
-- to a code constant (an UPDATE on a missing row changes nothing and reports no
-- error), and it was NOT harmless for `jetstream_healthy`, whose writer is an
-- UPDATE that matched zero rows, so the Jetstream listener could never record
-- itself unhealthy and the atproto polling fallback never engaged.
--
-- THE RULE (CLAUDE.md, tuning-dial section)
--
--   A migration must NOT seed platform_config. New dials go HERE.
--
-- CI-enforced by scripts/check-schema-drift.sh Check 4, which allowlists exactly
-- the 11 historical migrations below (migrations are immutable, so that set is
-- closed forever) and rejects an INSERT INTO platform_config in any other one.
--
-- ON CONFLICT (key) DO NOTHING is load-bearing on every statement: this file is
-- re-applied on every migrate run, so it seeds a missing default and must NEVER
-- overwrite a value an operator has tuned.
--
-- NOT here, deliberately: runtime STATE that happens to live in this table.
-- `payouts_halted` means "halted" by its presence and is DELETEd to resume
-- (payment-service/src/lib/payout-halt.ts) — a seeded default would fight the
-- resume path. Absence is its meaning; only tuning dials belong in this file.
--
-- The blocks below are the historical seeds, verbatim from the migration that
-- introduced each, in chronological order.

-- Stripe funds segregation / allocated funds (FUNDS-SEGREGATION-INTEGRATION.md
-- §3.3b, §3.3c, §3.3d; migration 165). Read by payment-service's payout cycles
-- and the allocation-sync sweep. All three are dials rather than constants for
-- the reason the tuning-dials invariant gives: their right values are only
-- knowable by measuring live distributions, so retuning must be an UPDATE and
-- not a deploy. They are inert while STRIPE_ALLOCATED_FUNDS is off.
--
-- MEASURED 2026-07-30 — AND THE ANSWER WAS "NOT YET MEASURABLE". The baseline
-- queries (scripts/segregation-baseline.sql) were run against production and
-- every figure came back zero: no payouts in the window, no writers over
-- threshold, no connected accounts. Migration 165 IS applied (16:35:05 on
-- 2026-07-29) and the window is entirely post-165, so the plumbing is right —
-- there is simply no money yet, the site being gated pre-launch. So BOTH dials
-- below keep their placeholders, and the reason is now recorded rather than
-- merely pending: this is blocked on the platform having payout volume, not on
-- anyone doing a task. Re-run the queries once payouts flow. Read a zero here as
-- NO MEASUREMENT, never as perfect coverage — the same distinction
-- summariseResidual() makes by returning null on an empty denominator.
--
-- Corollary worth knowing before the first cycle: a residual share computed off
-- a *tiny* denominator is arithmetically fine and statistically meaningless, so
-- expect noise from this alert on the first few payout cycles. That is the
-- sample, not the threshold.
--
-- `allocated_residual_alert_bps` IS A PLACEHOLDER AND MUST BE RE-SET BEFORE THE
-- LIVE FLIP. The residual has a STRUCTURAL floor, not an exceptional one: every
-- credit-funded penny lands there by construction, forever (a subscription
-- charge covered by pre-paid credit has no settlement and therefore no charge to
-- draw on). Set it from 30 days of production data — Σ subscription_credit plus
-- charge-time-stamped subscription_earning, over Σ writer payouts for the same
-- window — with headroom above that floor. A threshold chosen without the
-- baseline fires on day one and gets muted, which is worse than no alert. Note
-- the spend→subscription conversion has been dark since 2026-07-16
-- (SUBSCRIPTION_CONVERT_ENABLED), so a trailing window measures only the live
-- logSubscriptionCharge branch — the honest CURRENT floor — and this dial must
-- be revisited if that flag is ever re-lit.
--
-- `payout_max_slices` bounds the tail, not the ordinary case: transfer volume
-- grows from O(writers) to roughly O(writers × charges drawn), and a writer
-- whose earnings span hundreds of charges should roll the excess to the next
-- cycle rather than be paid in hundreds of transfers. Pick the starting value
-- from the real distribution (`SELECT count(DISTINCT tab_settlement_id)` per
-- unpaid writer balance) — 20 covers the dev distribution and is a guess about
