// §0o.9c — loadConfig's MONEY-dial fallbacks must match config-defaults.sql.
//
// Third of the parity trio (gateway feed-rank, feed-ingest resonance, this),
// and the one whose file the docblock is a monument to: from f8c73e6 until
// 2026-07-20 these dials existed ONLY as the fallbacks below, because a
// --schema-only regeneration silently dropped the INSERT that seeded them. An
// UPDATE on a missing row changes nothing and raises nothing, so the platform
// fee, the free allowance and both settlement thresholds were untunable and
// nothing said so.
//
// That is why the fallback's own correctness matters here more than in the
// twins. A drifted fallback is invisible exactly when the row is absent —
// which is the one case the fallback exists for — and these are the money
// dials: the platform's cut, what a reader is gifted, when a card is charged,
// when a writer is paid. Drift here does not error; it moves money by a
// number no operator can see.
//
// Drives the REAL loader against an empty table, so it asserts the shipping
// fallback path rather than a copy of it. Ordinary suite, no DB needed: the
// pool is stubbed at the one call loadConfig makes.
