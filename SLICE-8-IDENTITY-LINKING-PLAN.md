# Slice 8 — Cross-source identity linking (implementation plan)

Re-based implementation plan for FEED-INGEST-ATTACK-PLAN.md § "Slice 8 —
Cross-source identity linking". The original slice spec predates two
architectural changes and must be reconciled before building:

1. **`external_authors` now exists** (migration 099) — the slice spec says
   *"No `external_authors` table yet. Identity linking works at the source
   level."* The table now exists with a `(protocol, stable_handle)` identity
   key and an unused lazy-claim `account_id` slot, and post aggregation is
   already centralised on `feed_items.external_author_id`.
2. **The Subscriptions page was retired** — the slice spec hangs its UI off
   `web/src/pages/subscriptions.tsx` and "subscription management UI". That
   page is gone; external subscriptions are feed-derived. The "Link to…"
   affordance moves to the external **author profile** surface.

This plan supersedes §8C/§8F of the original slice for those two points; §8A,
§8B, §8D, §8E stand.

## Codebase reconciliation (audit 2026-06-20)

Two assumptions in the draft don't match the current code; both are corrected in
the sections below, recorded here so the build doesn't re-trip them.

1. **The resolver does not persist a source.** `POST /api/resolve`
   (`gateway/src/routes/resolve.ts`, `gateway/src/lib/resolver.ts`) is a pure
   classifier — it returns `{ protocol, sourceUri, …metadata }` *matches* with
   **no `external_sources.id`** and writes nothing to `external_sources`. The
   link table FKs `external_sources(id)`, so "Link to…" is a **two-step**:
   resolve → then upsert via the existing `addSource` path
   (`gateway/src/routes/feeds/sources.ts:354`,
   `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (protocol, source_uri) … RETURNING id`). The
   `SourceFollowPicker` in `ProfileFollowControl.tsx` already does exactly this
   resolve-shape → `addSource` dance; model the Link wiring on it. See UI (P2).
2. **There is no stored author→source link.** The external author profile is
   keyed on `external_authors`; its backing `external_sources.id` is computed at
   query time from `(protocol, source_uri)` and surfaces as
   `followTarget.sourceId` (`gateway/src/routes/author.ts:168-190`,
   null when no source row exists yet). For a tier-A/B author shown in-feed that
   row always exists (the author was ingested through it), so it is a valid
   `source_a_id`. Tier-C/D RSS/email have no author profile, so they enter a
   link only as the **target** the user pastes in, or via P3 detection —
   consistent with the source-level grain.

Confirmed as-specced (no change needed): `sourceFilteredItems`'s `$1 = readerId`
(so the owner filter `owner_id IS NULL OR owner_id = $1` needs **no new query
param**); `external_items` is already joined in the `scored` CTE via
`fi.external_item_id` (`gateway/src/lib/feed-sql.ts:97`); `external_items` has
both `canonical_url` and `content_text`; `biddability_tier` lives on `feed_items`
(A/B/C/D); `pgcrypto`/`digest()` is enabled. The next free migration number is
**123** (122 is the highest in `migrations/`).

## Decisions locked

- **Link grain: source-level.** `external_identity_links` references
  `external_sources(id)`, per the original §8C — *not* author-level. Rationale:
  tier-C/D RSS/email rows have no `external_authors` record, and the slice's own
  examples make RSS one of the three cross-posted surfaces, so author-level
  linking can't represent them. Source-level also matches the grain of the
  dedup payoff (item/source-level content fingerprinting).
- **`external_authors.account_id` claim slot: deferred.** Wiring the lazy-claim
  slot belongs to the deferred "constructed external author profile pages" work
  (CARD-BEHAVIOUR-ADR §VI.3), not here.
- **Link ownership: owner-aware hybrid, keyed on provenance** (see below).
- **Fingerprint tiers: canonical-URL + text-hash only.** The §8D tier-2 rule
  (title + published_at ±5 min) is dropped from the hot path — it needs a range
  join, is the lowest-precision signal, and is the expensive one.

## Phasing

| Phase | Work | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 — Dedup core** | link table migration + precomputed fingerprint + query-time dedup CTE in `sourceFilteredItems` + `ALSO ON` provenance | ~1 wk | **shipped 2026-06-20** |
| **P2 — User-asserted links** | "Link to…" / "Unlink" on the external author profile, resolver-backed; owner-scoped links only | ~3–4 days | **shipped 2026-06-20** |
| **P3 — Automated detection** | daily `identity_link_detect` task (domain-match + bridge shipped; cross-link deferred); introduces global links + the negative-override unlink | ~3 days | **shipped 2026-06-20** |

Total ≈ 2 weeks. No infrastructure gate — pure application logic.

### P1 — what shipped (2026-06-20)

- **Migration 123** (`123_identity_links_and_dedup_fingerprint.sql`):
  `external_identity_links` (ordered-pair `CHECK (source_a_id < source_b_id)`,
  partial unique indexes for the global vs owner-scoped cases, `link_type` CHECK
  carrying the full P2/P3 vocabulary incl. `user_unlinked`), plus
  `external_items.dedup_fingerprint` maintained by a `BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE`
  trigger (`external_items_set_fingerprint` → `external_items_compute_fingerprint`
  → `external_items_norm_text`) so every ingest adapter populates it for free; a
  one-time backfill seeds existing rows. `norm()` lower-cases, strips URLs,
  collapses whitespace, takes the first 200 chars; the fingerprint is the
  canonical URL else a sha256 of the normalised text, **only above a 32-char
  floor** (short/generic posts stay NULL → never deduped). `schema.sql`
  regenerated; `scripts/check-schema-drift.sh` green.
- **Dedup query** (`gateway/src/routes/feeds/items.ts::sourceFilteredItems`):
  `linked_sources` / `candidates` / `suppressed` CTEs + the `fi.id NOT IN
  suppressed` filter + the `also_on` provenance lateral (`source_protocol::text`
  so node-pg returns a real `string[]`). The `source_id IN linked_sources` guard
  keeps zero-link feeds at near-zero cost.
- **`alsoOn`** added to both Post shapes (`gateway/.../post-mapper.ts` +
  `web/src/lib/post/types.ts`) and rendered as a quiet `ALSO ON …` line in
  `web/src/components/post/PostOriginTag.tsx`.
- **Inert until P2.** No links exist yet, so the dedup CTEs return empty and the
  feed is unchanged — exactly the build-order intent below.
- **Not yet done in P1:** the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` against a seeded large linked
  feed (Risks §), and the test matrix (winner selection / cross-page suppression
  / canonical-vs-hash grouping / zero-links fast path) — both deferred to land
  with P2 once real links make them exercisable.

> Build order note: P1 ships the dedup machinery but it stays inert until P2
> creates the first links. P1+P2 only ever produce owner-scoped links, so the
> owner model's negative-override wrinkle does not exist until P3 (see
> "Link ownership").

### P2 — what shipped (2026-06-20)

No DDL — migration 123's `external_identity_links` already carries the
`user_asserted` link type. P2 is the create/unlink CRUD + UI that produces the
first links, turning P1's machinery live.

- **Gateway routes** (`gateway/src/routes/identity-links.ts`, registered under
  `/api/v1`): `POST /author/:authorId/links { protocol, sourceUri }` and
  `DELETE /author/:authorId/links/:linkId`. `source_a` (the viewed author's
  backing source) is derived **server-side** from `authorId` via the exported
  `loadAuthorLinkSource` (`author.ts`) — never trusted from the client. The pair
  is stored `LEAST/GREATEST(::uuid)`-ordered to satisfy the table's
  `source_a_id < source_b_id` CHECK, owner-scoped (`owner_id = viewer`,
  `confidence 1.0`), `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE` so a re-assert is idempotent.
- **Deviation from the draft's two-step (deliberate):** the plan sketched a
  client-side resolve→`addSource` dance to mint `source_b`. `addSource` also
  writes feed membership + a subscription — linking is **not** following, so
  that would be a spurious follow side-effect. Instead the create route does its
  own minimal `external_sources` upsert (`ON CONFLICT (protocol, source_uri) DO
  UPDATE SET updated_at` — no `is_active`/`orphaned_at` revival) inside the same
  transaction as the link insert. Linking and following stay orthogonal.
- **GC made link-aware** (`feed-ingest/src/tasks/external-sources-gc.ts`): a
  link-only `source_b` (pasted as a link target, never subscribed) has zero
  `external_subscriptions`, so the cull Phase B would hard-delete it and
  CASCADE-drop the link. Phase B now spares any source referenced by an
  `external_identity_links` row (Phase A still deactivates it — a link-only
  source shouldn't be polled — but it's never culled while a link survives).
- **Profile payload:** `AuthorCardResponse.linkedSources` (gateway
  `author-resolve.ts` + web `lib/api/post.ts` mirror); `/author/:id/profile`
  populates the viewer's own `user_asserted` links touching `source_a`
  (CASE-join to the other side), so the surface renders the chips + unlink
  without a separate fetch.
- **UI** (`web/src/components/profile/IdentityLinkControl.tsx`): a "Link to…" /
  "Linked · N ▾" control in `AuthorProfileView`'s actions cell beside
  `ProfileFollowControl`, **external authors only** (`followTarget.type ===
  "source"`). Resolver-backed (`useResolverInput`, omnivorous input); only the
  external-source `{ protocol, sourceUri }` resolver variant is linkable
  (native account / #tag filtered out), already-linked targets filtered. Linked
  chips carry an unlink ✕. All glasshouse-light idioms (white pane, `*-well`
  field, `grey-600` labels); hairline tripwire green.
- **Verified end-to-end** (rolled-back dev-DB transaction): identical
  fingerprints group; winner selection drops only the lower-biddability twin
  (A beats C); `also_on` surfaces the linked protocol; the **zero-link control
  suppresses nothing** (the perf fast path); A/B and B/A re-asserts collapse to
  one row.

### P1/P2 deferrals — closed (2026-06-20)

The two items the P1/P2 ship notes punted ("ride the next test pass") are now done:

- **Dedup SQL factored out** (`gateway/src/lib/dedup-sql.ts`): the
  `linked_sources`/`candidates`/`suppressed` CTEs + the suppress filter + the
  provenance lateral are now exported constants spliced into `items.ts`, so the
  test exercises the *exact* SQL the live feed runs — no second copy to drift.
- **Integration suite** (`gateway/tests/dedup-integration.test.ts`, 7 tests):
  fingerprint trigger (canonical-URL identity, text-hash, 32-char floor), winner
  selection by tier (A beats C), same-tier tie-break by `published_at`, text-hash
  grouping with no canonical URL, distinct-content non-grouping, the zero-link
  fast path, and **owner-scoped visibility** (a reader's `user_asserted` link
  doesn't leak into another reader's feed; a global link does). Seeds fixtures in
  a transaction that is always rolled back. `describe.skipIf(!DB_URL)` so the
  no-Postgres CI `test` job stays green; run locally with
  `TEST_DATABASE_URL=… npx vitest run tests/dedup-integration.test.ts`.
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** (`gateway/scripts/explain-dedup.ts`): seeds a 200-source /
  4 000-item feed (real `feeds`/`feed_sources` membership) and EXPLAINs the
  faithful dedup path at three link densities. The `linked_sources` guard
  confirmed: **zero links ≈ 19 ms, a few links ≈ 22 ms, all-linked worst case ≈
  95 ms** — cost scales with link density, near-free at the common end.
- **Perf fix found by the EXPLAIN:** the provenance lateral was computed for
  *every* survivor *before* the `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` (O(survivors × candidates) —
  the dominant cost at high link density, ~1.8 s on the all-linked worst case).
  `also_on` is display-only on the returned page, so `items.ts` now computes it
  **after** the cursor/order/limit, over the ≤`$3` returned rows. Worst case
  dropped ~1.8 s → ~95 ms with identical results; ordering re-imposed at the
  outer level (a lateral join doesn't preserve subquery order, and the JS reads
  the last row for `nextCursor`).

### P3 — what shipped (2026-06-20)

No DDL — migration 123 already carries the `bridge`/`cross_link`/`domain_match`/
`user_unlinked` link types. P3 turns global automated links on and wires the
negative override end-to-end. **Evidence source: stored metadata only** (no remote
fetch, no SSRF surface — the locked decision).

- **Read-path tombstone** (`gateway/src/lib/dedup-sql.ts`): the dedup CTEs now
  open with an `applicable_links` CTE — global (owner NULL) ∪ the reader's own
  assertions, **minus** the `user_unlinked` type itself **and** any pair the
  reader has tombstoned — reused by `linked_sources`, `suppressed`, and the
  provenance lateral. So a reader who unlinks a *detected* link stops deduping it
  while everyone else is unaffected.
- **Unlink route** (`identity-links.ts` DELETE): own `user_asserted` → hard
  DELETE (unchanged); a global link (owner NULL) → insert an owner-scoped
  `user_unlinked` tombstone for the same (already-ordered) pair (can't delete a
  global fact for everyone). Another reader's assertion / an existing tombstone →
  404.
- **Profile payload** (`author.ts` + `author-resolve.ts` + web `post.ts`): the
  `linkedSources` query now merges the viewer's own links with global detected
  links touching the author's source (minus tombstoned pairs), each carrying
  `detected: boolean`; deduped per other-source, own-first.
- **Detection task** (`feed-ingest/src/tasks/identity-link-detect.ts`, behind
  `IDENTITY_LINK_DETECT_ENABLED`, cron 06:30 UTC registered only when on — the
  trust-cron pattern): **domain_match** (confidence 0.6) from stored metadata —
  a source's owned *custom* domains (RSS feed host · author `website` host ·
  atproto custom-handle host), two sources sharing one ⇒ a global link.
  **False-positive guards (content suppression — correctness is the game):** an
  explicit shared-platform denylist (`bsky.social`, `mastodon.social`,
  `substack.com`, `*.brid.gy`, …) **plus** a self-tuning count guard — a domain
  claimed by more than `MAX_SOURCES_PER_DOMAIN` (4) sources is treated as a
  platform and dropped. **Self-healing:** each run fully recomputes the global
  `domain_match` set in one transaction (DELETE + re-INSERT); tombstones match on
  the pair, not the link row, so they survive the recompute. Pure helpers
  (`registrableDomain`/`ownedDomains`/`domainMatchPairs`) are unit-tested
  (`identity-link-detect.test.ts`, 13 tests, no DB).
- **UI** (`IdentityLinkControl.tsx`): detected chips carry a "· DETECTED" tag and
  the unlink aria reads "Stop merging this source" (it's a tombstone, not a
  delete). All glasshouse-light idioms; hairline tripwire green.
- **Verified:** the read-path tombstone via an 8th dedup integration test (a
  global link suppresses for all, a reader's `user_unlinked` subtracts it for that
  reader only); the detection task end-to-end via a rolled-back dev-DB smoke (RSS
  + custom atproto handle on the same domain ⇒ one owner-NULL `domain_match`
  link). Full suites green (gateway 149, feed-ingest 174).
- **Deferred (the link_type vocab already supports it):** `cross_link`
  (bidirectional profile references parsed from bios) — another detector writing
  its own link_type with its own recompute, slots into the same task; needs cached
  bio metadata to honour the stored-metadata-only rule. Also deferred: the
  quorum-promotion network-effect recovery (below) and a Vitest suite over the
  route layer (the routes are exercised only via the read-path integration test +
  the live smoke).

### P3 follow-on — bridge detector (shipped 2026-06-20)

The `bridge` detector now ships alongside `domain_match` in the same
`identity_link_detect` task (`feed-ingest/src/tasks/identity-link-detect.ts`,
link_type `'bridge'`, confidence 0.95). **Evidence source: stored metadata only**
— the original identity is embedded in the bridged mirror's own identity string,
so no remote fetch (the SLICE-8 decision holds).

- **Three signals, each keying on a globally-unique original identifier read off
  the stored string:**
  - Bridgy Fed **Bluesky→fediverse**: the AP mirror's actor URL
    `https://bsky.brid.gy/ap/<DID>` ⇒ extract the DID ⇒ link to the native
    `atproto` source whose `source_uri` *is* that DID.
  - **mostr.pub Nostr→fediverse**: the AP mirror's actor URL embeds the original
    `npub` ⇒ `nip19` decode to hex ⇒ link to the native `nostr_external` source.
  - Bridgy Fed **fediverse→Bluesky**: the atproto mirror's handle
    `<user>.<instance>.ap.brid.gy` ⇒ reconstruct `<user>@<instance>` ⇒ link to
    the native `activitypub` source with that `external_authors.handle`.
- **False-positive guard:** a pair links only when **≥1 endpoint is a bridge
  mirror** (the decoded-key-vs-native-key grouping with an `isBridge` flag), so
  two unrelated natives that happen to share a key never link; a mirror whose
  identity fails to decode contributes nothing (never falls back to its
  bridge-host native key). `mostr.pub` added to the `PLATFORM_DOMAINS` denylist.
- **Conflict ordering:** `uq_idlink_global` is unique on the *pair alone* (one
  global link per pair, any link_type), so the recompute DELETEs both global
  automated types then inserts **bridge before domain_match** — the higher-
  confidence, more specific signal wins a pair both detectors claim. Self-healing
  full recompute in one transaction, same as domain_match; `user_unlinked`
  tombstones key on the pair so they survive.
- **Verified:** 16 new unit tests over the pure helpers
  (`npubToHex`/`decodeApBridgeHandle`/`bridgeIdentityKeys`/`bridgeMatchPairs` —
  all three signal directions, the ≥1-bridge guard, the no-match and
  failed-decode cases, the deduped two-network case) — feed-ingest suite 190
  green; a rolled-back dev-DB smoke confirming bridge wins the shared-pair
  conflict over domain_match (survivor `bridge`/0.95).

### Dedup correctness fix — transitive connectivity (2026-06-21)

The P1 suppression was **pairwise**: a candidate lost only to a *directly*-linked
twin (`suppressed` joined `applicable_links` on the exact pair). That leaks when
the links of a same-fingerprint set form a **chain or star** rather than a clique:
if the connecting source is the loser it is suppressed by both ends, leaving two
copies that share a fingerprint but aren't *directly* linked **both surviving** —
the duplicate the feature exists to hide. Reachable via a `user_asserted` chain
(link A–B then B–C, never A–C) and a `bridge` star (a native linked to two mirrors
that aren't linked to each other); `domain_match` was already safe because
`domainMatchPairs` emits the full clique.

Fixed in `gateway/src/lib/dedup-sql.ts`: dedup is now over **connected components**
of the applicable-link graph, not direct pairs. New CTEs `link_edges` (symmetric +
reflexive) → `link_closure` (recursive transitive closure; UNION ⇒ terminates) →
`source_component` (component id = `MIN(reach::text)`, equality-only key — there is
no `min(uuid)` aggregate). `candidates` inner-joins `source_component` (same
zero-link perf guard, now also tagging each row's component), and `suppressed` /
the provenance lateral group by `(comp, fp)` instead of a direct link. One
component → one survivor under the unchanged total order (tier, `published_at`,
`source_id`, `fi_id`). **Host requirement:** the recursive CTE forces the outer
`WITH` → `WITH RECURSIVE` at all four splice sites (`feeds/items.ts`, the two test
SQL constants, `scripts/explain-dedup.ts`).

- **Verified:** two new integration tests (`dedup-integration.test.ts`, now 10) —
  a 3-source chain and a star — each **fails under the old pairwise SQL** (proves
  the leak) and passes under the fix; full gateway suite 151 green.
- **Perf:** re-ran `scripts/explain-dedup.ts` — the closure adds ~1 ms; zero-link
  ≈16 ms, a few links ≈20 ms, all-linked worst case ≈62 ms (no regression vs the
  P1 baseline; worst case unchanged-to-better, suppressed count still exact).

## Schema

Schema discipline: after the migrations, regenerate `schema.sql` via `pg_dump`
+ re-append the `_migrations` seed in one step, then run
`scripts/check-schema-drift.sh` (CI-enforced). Do not hand-edit `schema.sql`.

## Dedup design (P1)

### Why naïve dedup fails
The workspace feed (`gateway/src/routes/feeds/items.ts:178` `sourceFilteredItems`)
is keyset-paginated by `effective_score DESC, fi_id DESC`. Two cross-posted
copies have *different* `effective_score` (different source weights, micro-
different `published_at`, `random` sampling re-rolls per query), so they are not
adjacent — one copy can be on page 1, its twin on page 3. Window-function /
in-page dedup only sees the current page and leaks the duplicate.

### Approach: page-independent winner + global suppression over the candidate set
Pick the winner by a rule independent of the page and of `effective_score`, then
suppress losers across the feed's whole candidate set (`matched` materialises all
matches *before* the `LIMIT`).

**Winner rule (total order):**
```
rank = (tierPriority ASC, published_at ASC, source_id ASC, fi.id ASC)
       tierPriority: A→0  B→1  C→2  D→3      (highest biddability tier wins, §8D)
```

**Fingerprint:** precomputed `external_items.dedup_fingerprint` folds §8D tier-1
(canonical URL) and tier-3 (normalised text hash) into one equality key. Tier-2
(title + ±5 min) deferred. Scope: external items only — natives aren't
cross-posted through these sources.

### CTEs (added after the existing `matched` CTE)

The critical perf guard: **only linked sources can produce duplicates**, so
prefilter to them. Most feeds have zero links → the dedup CTEs are empty →
near-zero added cost. Dedup is free until someone links something.

```sql
linked_sources AS (                      -- sources appearing in ANY applicable link
  SELECT source_a_id AS sid FROM external_identity_links
    WHERE owner_id IS NULL OR owner_id = $1
  UNION
  SELECT source_b_id FROM external_identity_links
    WHERE owner_id IS NULL OR owner_id = $1
),
candidates AS (                          -- matched items eligible for dedup
  SELECT m.fi_id, fi.source_id, fi.published_at,
         fi.biddability_tier AS tier, ei.dedup_fingerprint AS fp
  FROM matched m
  JOIN feed_items fi ON fi.id = m.fi_id
  JOIN external_items ei ON ei.id = fi.external_item_id        -- external only
  WHERE ei.dedup_fingerprint IS NOT NULL
    AND fi.source_id IN (SELECT sid FROM linked_sources)        -- the guard
),
suppressed AS (                          -- losers: a linked, better-ranked twin exists
  SELECT c.fi_id
  FROM candidates c
  JOIN candidates d
    ON d.fp = c.fp AND d.fi_id <> c.fi_id
  JOIN external_identity_links l
    ON ((l.source_a_id = c.source_id AND l.source_b_id = d.source_id)
     OR (l.source_b_id = c.source_id AND l.source_a_id = d.source_id))
   AND (l.owner_id IS NULL OR l.owner_id = $1)
  WHERE ( tprio(d.tier) <  tprio(c.tier) )
     OR ( tprio(d.tier) =  tprio(c.tier)
          AND (d.published_at, d.source_id, d.fi_id)
            < (c.published_at, c.source_id, c.fi_id) )
)
```
`tprio(t)` inlines as `CASE t WHEN 'A' THEN 0 WHEN 'B' THEN 1 WHEN 'C' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END`.

One line added to the existing `scored` WHERE:
```sql
AND fi.id NOT IN (SELECT fi_id FROM suppressed)
```

The suppression universe is `candidates` (this feed's own matches), **not** global
`feed_items` — so we never hide `fi` in favour of a winner that isn't itself in
this feed (which would show neither copy).

### Provenance note ("ALSO ON BLUESKY · MASTODON")
Computed only for survivors (a handful of rows, post-filter) via a lateral in the
outer SELECT. Note: the outer select is `SELECT * FROM scored`, and `scored` does
**not** project the fingerprint (`fp` is on `external_items`, outside
`FEED_SELECT`/`POST_SELECT`). So the outer select becomes
`SELECT scored.*, prov.also_on FROM scored LEFT JOIN LATERAL (…) prov ON true`,
and the lateral joins `external_items` on `scored.external_item_id` to recover
`scored.fp` for the match below (or surface `fp`/`source_id` from a wrapping CTE).
Preserve `effective_score`/`fi_id` in the projection — the JS `nextCursor`
(`items.ts:293-300`) reads them.
```sql
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT array_agg(DISTINCT d.source_protocol) AS also_on

Surface as an optional `Post.alsoOn?: string[]` — add the field to **both** the
gateway shape (`gateway/src/lib/post-mapper.ts`, read `row.also_on` in
`feedItemToPost`) and its web mirror (`web/src/lib/post/types.ts`, kept
structurally identical). Render a quiet mono-caps line on the winning card in
`web/src/components/post/PostOriginTag.tsx` (reuse its `PROTOCOL_DISPLAY` map +
`TagText` helper: `ALSO ON …`, no hairline — run `scripts/check-hairlines.sh`).
Empty/undefined ⇒ nothing rendered, so unlinked feeds are visually untouched.

## Link ownership (the owner model)

The principle, consistent with the rest of the system: **objective facts are
global; unverifiable assertions are scoped to the asserter.** (`external_sources`
global vs `external_subscriptions` per-owner; the trust graph is viewer-relative
and attributed; `network_presences` earns its global unique key only because it's
OAuth-proven.) A blanket "user-asserted links are global" would be the only place
where one user's unverified claim suppresses content and stamps a public identity
assertion in everyone else's feed — asymmetric harm (one griefer vs marginal
convenience), so scope it down.

| `link_type` | Truth | Scope | Writer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bridge`, `domain_match`, `cross_link` | objective, re-verifiable | **global** (`owner_id NULL`), confidence < 1.0 | daily detection task (single writer, self-healing) |
| `user_asserted` | one reader's unverified claim | **owner-scoped** (`owner_id = asserter`), confidence 1.0 | the "Link to…" action |

Dedup applies global links **plus the reader's own** assertions, reusing the
`$1 = readerId` param already in `sourceFilteredItems`:
`AND (l.owner_id IS NULL OR l.owner_id = $1)`.

### Unlink semantics (sequenced to phasing)
- Unlinking your **own** `user_asserted` link → `DELETE` the owner-scoped row.
- Unlinking a **global automated** link → can't delete a verified fact for
  everyone; write an owner-scoped **negative override** (a per-reader tombstone
  the query subtracts).

The negative-override complexity exists *only* once global automated links exist:

- **P2 (user-asserted only):** every row has `owner_id NOT NULL`. Unlink = delete.
  Query filter is just `l.owner_id = $1`. No NULL-owner branch, no tombstones.
- **P3 (automated detection lands):** add `owner_id IS NULL` global rows, flip the
  filter to `IS NULL OR = $1`, add the negative override (`link_type =
  'user_unlinked'`, owner-scoped; the `suppressed`/`linked_sources` CTEs exclude
  any pair the reader has tombstoned). UI must then distinguish "you linked this"
  from "automatically detected" so unlink reads honestly.

### Deferred: network-effect recovery (P3+)
Owner-scoping loses the "first linker helps everyone" effect. Recover it safely
via **quorum promotion**: when N independent readers assert the same
`user_asserted` pair, the detection task promotes it to a global link
(`link_type = 'crowd'`, confidence scaled by N) — the trust-graph pattern (many
attributed opinions → a derived fact), never a single actor. Don't build in v1.

## UI (P2) — re-based off the retired Subscriptions page

The "Link to…" / "Unlink" affordances live on the **external author profile**
surface (`AuthorProfileView` full-page + the overlay; the profile-surfaces
invariant already concentrates per-author actions there), not a Subscriptions
page.

- "Link to…" opens a resolver-backed input (`POST /api/resolve`,
  `gateway/src/lib/resolver.ts`) — paste a URL/handle from another platform.
  Omnivorous input per the sitewide rule. **The resolver only classifies; it
  returns no `external_sources.id`** (see Codebase reconciliation #1), so the
  flow is two-step: take the chosen match's `{ protocol, sourceUri }`, **upsert
  it via the `addSource` path** (`gateway/src/routes/feeds/sources.ts:354`,
  `RETURNING id`) to get a persisted `source_b_id`, then insert the owner-scoped
  `user_asserted` link. `source_a_id` is the current author's backing source —
  the `followTarget.sourceId` already on the profile payload (always present for
  a tier-A/B author shown in-feed; see reconciliation #2). Normalise
  `source_a_id < source_b_id` before insert. Reuse the
  `SourceFollowPicker` resolve→`addSource` wiring in `ProfileFollowControl.tsx`.
- New gateway routes: `POST` create-link + `DELETE` unlink (in `author.ts` or a
  sibling). At P2 every row is `owner_id NOT NULL`, so unlink = `DELETE` and the
  read filter is just `l.owner_id = $1` — no NULL-owner branch, no tombstones.
- **Surface placement:** the "Link to…" / "Unlink" affordance sits in
  `AuthorProfileView.tsx`'s actions cell (the `flex-shrink-0` slot beside
  `ProfileFollowControl`, lines ~247-251), the same per-author home the
  profile-surfaces invariant concentrates actions in.
- **Profile payload:** extend `AuthorCardResponse`
  (`gateway/src/lib/author-resolve.ts`) + the `/author/:id/profile` route with
  the viewer's existing linked sources for this author, so the surface can render
  "Unlink" and the `ALSO ON …` grouping the dedup query already emits.

## Risks / validation

- **Dedup correctness is the whole game** — a false-positive merge hides real
  distinct posts. The text-hash fallback can collide on short/generic posts; keep
  `norm()` conservative and consider a minimum-length floor before hashing.
- Detection task (P3) fetches remote profiles → must use the hardened client
  `shared/src/lib/http-client.ts` (SSRF invariant). Schedule it last, behind a
  flag.
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE the dedup CTE against a seeded large feed** — the
  `candidates` self-join is a hash join on `fp`, bounded by the `linked_sources`
  guard, but verify. Do this together with the deferred audit item #15 ("EXPLAIN
  the `scored` CTE against a large dataset") — same query, one pass.
- Tests (`feed-ingest/.../feed-batching.test.ts` is thin per audit D14): winner
  selection across tiers, cross-page suppression, canonical-URL vs text-hash
  grouping, the zero-links fast path, and (P2) owner-scoped visibility (my
  assertion doesn't leak into another reader's feed).
