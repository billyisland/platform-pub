// feed_items_author_refresh — daily metadata propagation
//
// Propagates changed author metadata from source tables to the denormalised
// feed_items columns. Six passes:
//   1. Native accounts → feed_items (display_name, avatar, username)
//   2. External sources → feed_items (display_name, avatar_url)
//   3. Native reply-parent author → feed_items.reply_to_author
//   4. External reply-parent author → feed_items.reply_to_author
//   5. Native reply-parent gone → feed_items.reply_to_author = NULL
//   6. External reply-parent gone → feed_items.reply_to_author = NULL
//
// Passes 3/4 fill late-arriving parents (a reply ingested before its parent has
// reply_to_author NULL until the parent lands) and track parent renames; 5/6 are
// their inverse, clearing a name whose parent has since been deleted or become
// unresolvable (§7.4 — without them a stale byline persists indefinitely). The
// feed_items_post_identity trigger resolves reply_to_author best-effort on INSERT;
// these passes are the maintainer (migration 105, audit C4 / #11).
//
// Up to 24 hours of staleness is acceptable per design.
// Runs daily at 04:00 UTC. See docs/adr/UNIVERSAL-FEED-ADR.md §V.2.
