// =============================================================================
// §8.14 — relay_outbox_prune ran a DELETE against a column that does not exist.
//
// The whole fault was `updated_at`: relay_outbox has created_at / last_attempt_at
// / sent_at and no updated_at, so every nightly run raised 42703, exhausted its
// 25 graphile attempts and left a dead job row nobody reads. Nothing had ever
// been pruned.
//
// This test HAS to be DB-backed. The defect is "the SQL names a column the
// schema doesn't have", which only Postgres can adjudicate — a mocked
// pool.query would answer from a fixture and pass just as happily against the
// broken query as against the fixed one (CLAUDE.md's mocked-query rule). The
// SQL is imported rather than copied for the same reason: a test that inlines a
// duplicate proves the duplicate.
//
// The negative control is the pre-fix DELETE verbatim, which must still raise
// 42703 — without it, a test that only asserts the new query works cannot tell
// you it is testing anything the old one failed.
//
// The discriminating case is `recentlySentButAncient`: created 200 days ago,
// sent 5 days ago. Retention is measured from when the row reached the RELAY,
// so it must SURVIVE — which is what separates this from a query that keys on
// created_at and would look correct on every other fixture here.
//
// Skipped unless a DB URL is supplied (CI's no-Postgres `test` job stays green).
