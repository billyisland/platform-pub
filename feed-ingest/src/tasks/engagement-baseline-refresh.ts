// =============================================================================
// engagement_baseline_refresh — daily author baselines + network ambient
// (SOCIAL-PROOF-RESONANCE-ADR D3, revised: recompute, don't fold)
//
// Rebuilds author_engagement_baseline and protocol_engagement_ambient from
// scratch each run. Deliberately NOT incremental: a true median can't be
// updated from (median, n) alone, and the <7d daily engagement sweep touches
// each item ~6 times, so fold-on-write would multiple-count posts into the
// baseline. Recompute is idempotent, self-healing after any refresh outage,
// and gives the D5 lag guarantee structurally — only posts >48h old (near-final
// E) enter a baseline, so a surging post is always measured against the
// author's PRIOR expectation, never against itself.
//
// Per-post E (weights from platform_config, resonance_* keys — see 158):
//   external: like·w_like + reply·w_reply + repost·w_repost
//             from external_items' denormalised counts (lifetime, monotonic
//             for nostr). nostr_external only when
//             NOSTR_ENGAGEMENT_COUNTS_ENABLED — dark rows would poison
//             baselines with zeros.
//   native:   up_votes·w_up + gate_passes·w_gate + replies·w_reply
//             from votes / read_events / feed_engagement (lifetime).
//             Down-votes never subtract (D2: valence is a separate axis).
//             Native reposts: not yet recorded for native targets
//             (repost-edge.ts "bind lazily") — weight seeded, term absent.
//
// Baseline = median E over the author's last ≤20 qualifying posts. Shrinkage
// toward ambient happens at SCORE time in the refresh crons
// ((n·median + k·p50)/(n + k)), not here — the table stores the raw estimate.
//
// Bounds: 180-day sample window (external_items are pruned anyway; native is
// bounded for the same reason — ancient posts shouldn't drag a baseline), one
// connection, temp tables, ~6 statements. Runs after the 04:00 UTC daily
// engagement sweep so it sees that run's counts.
