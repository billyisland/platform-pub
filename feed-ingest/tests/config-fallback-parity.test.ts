// =============================================================================
// §0h.7 — the in-code config fallbacks must match config-defaults.sql.
//
// Every tuning dial is read as `num(key, fallback)`, so each fallback is a
// second copy of a number whose canonical home is config-defaults.sql. Nothing
// held the two in step. That is the masking mechanism 1d6b756 diagnosed, one
// level up: a fallback substitutes silently for a dial that is absent or
// misspelled, so the system runs on a value no operator can see or tune — and
// because the substitution is silent, the symptom is never "config is broken",
// it is "the numbers look a bit off".
//
// The resonance weights make the stakes concrete. They are used in two places:
// the baseline cron (which builds the denominator distribution) and the scorer
// (which computes each post's ratio against it). A weight that drifted between
// the fallback and the seeded value would not error anywhere. It would score
// every post against a distribution built from a different formula, and the
// only visible effect would be bands that seem mis-tuned — sending someone off
// to retune the band gates, which are not the problem.
//
// This drives the REAL loader with an empty config, so it asserts the shipping
// fallback path rather than a copy of the table.
